# ENG-B-CPDV2009-pd-PSFM
Catholic Public Domain Version in USFM/PSFM format


Catholic Public Domain Version in P.SFM format

This is the development branch.

The P.SFM source is at (https://github.com/BeTheLight/ENG-B-CPDV2009-pd-PSFM.)

The USFM source is at (https://gitlab.com/crosswire-bible-society/cpdv)

What's the difference between USFM and P.SFM? Not much, but enough to mess up automated scripts.
