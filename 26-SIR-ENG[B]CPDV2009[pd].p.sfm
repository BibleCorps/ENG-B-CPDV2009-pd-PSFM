\cl Sirach Prologue
\p
\v 1 The wisdom of many great things has been revealed to us through the law, and the prophets, and the other books that followed these. Concerning these things, Israel ought to be praised, because of doctrine and wisdom. For it is necessary, not only for those who are speaking, but even for outsiders, to be skillful, both in speaking and in writing, so as to become very learned.\f + \fr P:1 \ft In my humble considered opinion, this prologue is just as inspired and infallible as any and all chapters of Sacred Scripture.\f*
\p
\v 2 My grandfather Jesus, after he gave himself fully to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books that were handed down to us by our ancestors, also wanted to write something himself, about the things that pertain to doctrine and wisdom, so that those who desire to learn and to become skillful in these things would be more and more attentive in mind, and would be strengthened to live according to the law.
\p
\v 3 And so, I exhort you to approach with benevolence, and to perform the reading with attentive study, and to be forbearing in these things when we may seem, while pursuing the image of wisdom, to fall short in the composition of words.
\p
\v 4 For the Hebrew words are deficient when they have been translated into another language.
\p
\v 5 And not only these words, but also the law itself, and the prophets, and the remainder of the books, have no small difference from when they have been spoken in their own language.
\p
\v 6 For in the time of king Ptolemy Euergetes, in the thirty-eighth year after I had arrived in Egypt, after I had been there for a long time, I found, left behind there, books with a doctrine neither small nor contemptible.
\p
\v 7 And so I considered it to be both good and necessary for me to apply some significant diligence and labor in order to translate this book.
\p
\v 8 Then, after much attentiveness to doctrine over a length of time, I brought to a close the things being considered, so as to offer this book for those who are willing to apply their mind and to learn how they ought to conduct their way of life,\f + \fr P:8 \ft Translators must attend to doctrine, and not merely to words and history.\f*
\p
\v 9 for those who have decided to form their life in accord with the law of the Lord.

\cl Sirach 1
\p
\v 1 All wisdom is from the Lord God, and has always been with him, and is before all time.
\p
\v 2 Who has numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of the rain, and the days of the world? Who has measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?
\p
\v 3 Who has examined the wisdom of God, which precedes all things?
\p
\v 4 Wisdom was created before all things, and the understanding of prudence is before all time.
\p
\v 5 The Word of God on high is the source of wisdom, whose steps are eternal commandments.
\p
\v 6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed, and who has recognized her astuteness?
\p
\v 7 To whom has the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest? And who has understood the multiplicity of her steps?
\p
\v 8 The most high omnipotent Creator is One, and he is the mighty King, and he is exceedingly to be feared, sitting upon his throne, and he is the sovereign God.
\p
\v 9 He created wisdom through the Holy Spirit, and he saw her, and numbered her, and measured her.
\p
\v 10 And he poured her over all his works, and over all flesh, to the extent of his favor, and he has offered her to those who love him.
\p
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, and honor, and rejoicing, and a crown of exultation.
\p
\v 12 The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, and will give joy and gladness and length of days.
\p
\v 13 It will be well, in the very end, for him who fears the Lord, and on the day that he passes away, he will be blessed.
\p
\v 14 The love of God is honorable wisdom.
\p
\v 15 And those to whom she will appear for their consideration love her because of what they see and know of her great works.
\p
\v 16 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, and walks with elect women, and is known by the just and the faithful.
\p
\v 17 The fear of the Lord is the sanctity of knowledge.
\p
\v 18 Sanctity will guard and justify the heart, and will bestow happiness and joy.
\p
\v 19 It will be well with him who fears the Lord, and at the consummation of his days, he will be blessed.
\p
\v 20 To fear God is the fullness of wisdom, and it is a fullness from its fruits.
\p
\v 21 She will fill her entire house from her offspring, and storehouses from her treasures.
\p
\v 22 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, the completion of peace, and the fruit of salvation.
\p
\v 23 And the fear of the Lord has seen and numbered wisdom; but both are gifts of God.\f + \fr 1:23 \ft The terms ‘fear of the Lord’ and ‘wisdom’ are used in place of the pronouns, for the sake of clarity.\f*
\p
\v 24 Wisdom will distribute knowledge and an understanding of prudence; and she lifts up the glory of those who hold to her.
\p
\v 25 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and its branches are long-lived.
\p
\v 26 In the treasures of wisdom is understanding and the sanctity of knowledge. But to sinners, wisdom is an abomination.
\p
\v 27 The fear of the Lord expels sin.
\p
\v 28 For he who is without fear is not able to be justified. For the disposition of his spirit is his undoing.
\p
\v 29 Those who are patient will suffer for a brief time, and afterwards, happiness will return.
\p
\v 30 A noble mind will hide his words for a brief time, and then the lips of many will declare his understanding.
\p
\v 31 Among the treasures of wisdom is the outward sign of discipline.
\p
\v 32 But to those who sin, the worship of God is an abomination.
\p
\v 33 Son, if you desire wisdom, observe justice, and then God will offer her to you.
\p
\v 34 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline.
\p
\v 35 And what pleases him is faith and meekness. And so shall he complete his treasures.
\p
\v 36 You should not be incredulous to the fear of the Lord. And you should not draw close to him with a duplicitous heart.
\p
\v 37 You should not be a hypocrite in the sight of men. And you should not scandalize with your lips.
\p
\v 38 Attend to these things, otherwise you may fall and bring dishonor to your soul.
\p
\v 39 And then God may uncover your secrets, and he may cast you down forcefully in the midst of the congregation.
\p
\v 40 For you drew near to the Lord wickedly, and your heart was filled with deceit and falseness.
\c 2
\cl Sirach 2
\p
\v 1 Son, when you apply yourself to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare your soul for temptation.
\p
\v 2 Humble your heart, and persevere. Incline your ear, and accept words of understanding. And you should not hurry away in the time of distress.
\p
\v 3 Endure steadfastly for God. Join yourself to God, and persevere, so that your life may increase in the very end.
\p
\v 4 Accept everything that will happen to you, and persevere in your sorrow, and have patience in your humiliation.
\p
\v 5 For gold and silver are tested in fire, yet truly, acceptable men are tested in the furnace of humiliation.
\p
\v 6 Believe God, and he will restore you to health. And straighten your way, and hope in him. Observe his fear, and grow old in it.
\p
\v 7 You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy. And do not turn away from him, lest you fall.
\p
\v 8 You who fear the Lord, believe in him. And your reward will not be taken away.
\p
\v 9 You who fear the Lord, hope in him. And mercy will approach you, to your delight.
\p
\v 10 You who fear the Lord, love him. And your hearts will be illuminated.
\p
\v 11 My sons, consider the nations of men, and know that not one of them hoped in the Lord and was confounded.
\p
\v 12 For who has remained in his commandment and been abandoned? Or who has called upon him, and yet he despised him?
\p
\v 13 For God is upright and merciful, and he will forgive sins in the day of tribulation. And he is the Protector to all those who seek him in truth.
\p
\v 14 Woe to the duplicitous heart, and to the wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner who walks the earth by two ways!
\p
\v 15 Woe to the dissolute in heart, who do not trust God! For, as a result, they will not be protected by him.\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Both are viable translations: ‘who do not believe in God’ and ‘who do not believe God.’ Both meanings are correct.\f*
\p
\v 16 Woe to those who have lost endurance, and who have abandoned upright ways, and who have turned aside to depraved ways!
\p
\v 17 And what will they do when the Lord begins to examine them?
\p
\v 18 Those who fear the Lord will not be unbelieving toward his Word. And those who love him will keep to his way.
\p
\v 19 Those who fear the Lord will seek the things that are well-pleasing to him. And those who love him will be filled with his law.
\p
\v 20 Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and they will sanctify their souls in his sight.
\p
\v 21 Those who fear the Lord keep his commandments, and they will have patience even until his examination,
\p
\v 22 saying: “If we do not do penance, then we will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.”
\p
\v 23 For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him.
\c 3
\cl Sirach 3
\p
\v 1 The sons of wisdom are the Church of the just: and their generation is obedience and love.
\p
\v 2 Sons, listen to the judgment of your father, and act accordingly, so that you may be saved.
\p
\v 3 For God has honored the father in the sons, and, when seeking the judgment of the mother, he has confirmed it in the children.
\p
\v 4 He who loves God will plead with him on behalf of sins, and will keep himself away from sin, and will be heeded in the prayers of his days.
\p
\v 5 And, like one who stores up treasure, so also is he who honors his mother.
\p
\v 6 He who honors his father will find happiness in his own children, and he will be heeded in the day of his prayer.
\p
\v 7 He who honors his father will live a long life. And he who obeys his father will be a refreshment to his mother.
\p
\v 8 He who fears the Lord honors his parents, and he will serve them as masters, for it is they who conceived him.
\p
\v 9 In word and deed, and in all things, honor your father with patience,
\p
\v 10 so that a blessing may come to you from him, and so that his blessing may remain to the very end.
\p
\v 11 The blessing of the father strengthens the houses of the sons; but the curse of the mother uproots even its foundation.
\p
\v 12 Do not boast in the disgrace of your father; for his shame is not your glory.
\p
\v 13 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father, and a father without honor is a discredit to the son.
\p
\v 14 Son, support your father in his old age, and do not grieve him in his life.
\p
\v 15 And if his mind should fail, show kindness; and do not spurn him when you are in your strength. For almsgiving to the father will never be forgotten.
\p
\v 16 For even in return for the sin of the mother, good will be repaid to you.
\p
\v 17 And you will be built up in justice, and you will be remembered in the day of tribulation. And your sins will dissolve like ice in warm weather.
\p
\v 18 What an evil form has he who forsakes his father! And whoever exasperates his mother is accursed by God.
\p
\v 19 Son, perform your works in meekness, and you shall be loved beyond the glory of men.
\p
\v 20 However great you may be, humble yourself in all things, and you will find grace in the presence of God.
\p
\v 21 For only the power of God is great, and he is honored by the humble.
\p
\v 22 You should not seek the things that are too high for you, and you should not examine the things that are beyond your ability. But as for the things that God has entrusted to you, consider these always. But you should not be curious in too many of his works.
\p
\v 23 For it is not necessary for you to see with your own eyes the things that are hidden.
\p
\v 24 In unnecessary matters, do not choose to be an examiner of many different things, and you should not be curious about too many of his works.
\p
\v 25 For many things have been revealed to you, beyond the understanding of men.
\p
\v 26 Yet uncertainty in these things has also undermined many persons and has detained their minds in vanity.
\p
\v 27 A hardened heart will have evil in the very end, and he who loves peril will perish in it.
\p
\v 28 A heart advancing in two directions will not have success, and the depraved heart will be scandalized in this way.
\p
\v 29 A wicked heart will be burdened with sorrows, and a sinner will add further sins.
\p
\v 30 The synagogue of the arrogant will not be healed. For the stalk of sinfulness will take root in them, and it will not be understood.
\p
\v 31 The heart of the wise is understood by wisdom, and a good ear will listen to wisdom with all its desire.
\p
\v 32 A wise and understanding heart will abstain from sins, and will have success in works of justice.
\p
\v 33 Water extinguishes a burning fire, and almsgiving withstands sins.
\p
\v 34 And God is the watchman for him who repays a kindness. He remembers him afterwards, and in the time of his fall, he will find a firm support.
\c 4
\cl Sirach 4
\p
\v 1 Son, you should not cheat the poor out of alms, nor should you avert your eyes from a poor man.
\p
\v 2 You should not despise the hungry soul, and you should not aggravate a poor man in his need.
\p
\v 3 You should not afflict the heart of the needy, and you should not delay an offer to someone in anguish.
\p
\v 4 You should not make requests of one who is greatly troubled, and you should not avert your face from the indigent.
\p
\v 5 You should not avert your eyes from the needy out of anger. And you should not abandon those who seek help from you, so that they speak curses behind your back.
\p
\v 6 For the pleadings of him who speaks curses of you, in the bitterness of his soul, will be heeded. For the One who made him will heed him.
\p
\v 7 Make yourself a friend to the congregation of the poor, and humble your soul before an elder, and humble your head before the great.
\p
\v 8 Turn your ear without sadness toward the poor, and repay your debt, and respond to him peacefully in meekness.
\p
\v 9 Free him who suffers injury at the hand of the arrogant, and do not carry animosity in your soul.
\p
\v 10 In judging, be merciful to the orphan, like a father, and be merciful to their mother, like a husband.
\p
\v 11 And then you shall be like an obedient son of the Most High, and he will take pity on you more than a mother would.
\p
\v 12 Wisdom breathes life into her sons, and she lifts up those who are seeking her, and she will precede them in the way of justice.
\p
\v 13 And he who loves her loves life. And those who watch for her shall embrace her delights.
\p
\v 14 Those who hold to her will inherit life. And whatever place she enters, God will bless.
\p
\v 15 Those who serve her will yield to what is holy. And God loves those who love wisdom.
\p
\v 16 He who listens to her shall judge the nations. And he who gazes upon her will remain secure.
\p
\v 17 If he believes in her, he will inherit her, and whatever arises from him will be confirmed.
\p
\v 18 For she walks with him through temptation, and she chooses him from the beginning.
\p
\v 19 She will lead fear and dread and trials over him, and she will crucify him with the tribulation of her doctrine, until she has tested him in his thoughts and she can trust in his soul.
\p
\v 20 And then she will strengthen him, and lead him along a straight path, and rejoice in him.
\p
\v 21 And she will disclose her secrets to him, and she will store up treasure, of the knowledge and understanding of justice, in him.
\p
\v 22 But if he has wandered astray, she will leave him behind, and she will deliver him into the hands of his enemy.
\p
\v 23 Son, be continually observant, and keep away from evil.
\p
\v 24 For the sake of your soul, you should not be ashamed to speak the truth.
\p
\v 25 For there is a shame that brings sin, and there is a shame that brings glory and grace.
\p
\v 26 You should not accept a face contrary to your own face, nor should you accept a lie contrary to your own soul.
\p
\v 27 You should not enjoy the fall of your neighbor.
\p
\v 28 Neither should you withhold words at an opportunity for salvation. You should not conceal your wisdom in her beauty.
\p
\v 29 For wisdom is discerned within speech. And understanding and knowledge and doctrine are discerned in the words of those who understand and by their steadfastness in the works of justice.
\p
\v 30 You should not contradict a word of truth in any way. Otherwise, by a falsehood born of ignorance, you will be confounded.
\p
\v 31 You should not be ashamed to confess your sins, but do not subject yourself to any man because of sin.
\p
\v 32 Do not choose to stand against the face of the powerful, for you should not strive against the current of the river.
\p
\v 33 Suffer for justice, on behalf of your soul, and struggle, even unto death, on behalf of justice, and God will fight against your enemies on your behalf.
\p
\v 34 Do not choose to be quick with your words, nor unproductive or neglectful in your works.
\p
\v 35 Do not choose to be like a lion in your house, distressing those of your household, and oppressing those who are subject to you.
\p
\v 36 Do not let your hand be open when receiving, but closed when giving.
\c 5
\cl Sirach 5
\p
\v 1 Do not choose to seek iniquitous possessions, and you should not say: “I have all I need in life.” For it will be of no benefit to you in the time of retribution and darkness.
\p
\v 2 You should not pursue, in your strength, the desires of your heart.
\p
\v 3 And you should not say: “How powerful am I?” or, “Who will cast me down because of my deeds?” For God will vindicate with vengeance.
\p
\v 4 You should not say, “I sinned, and what grief has befallen me?” For the Most High is a patient recompensor.
\p
\v 5 Do not be willing to be without fear concerning a forgiven sin, and you should not add sin upon sin.
\p
\v 6 And you should not say: “The compassion of the Lord is great; he will take pity on the multitude of my sins.”
\p
\v 7 For both mercy and wrath go forth quickly from him, and his wrath sets its gaze upon sinners.
\p
\v 8 You should not delay being converted to the Lord, and you should not set it aside from day to day.
\p
\v 9 For his wrath will approach suddenly, and in the time of vindication, he will destroy you.
\p
\v 10 Do not choose to be anxious for unjust wealth. For these things will not benefit you in the day of darkness and retribution.
\p
\v 11 You should not winnow in every wind, and you should not go forth into every path. For so is every sinner proven by his duplicitous tongue.
\p
\v 12 Be steadfast in the way of the Lord and in the truth of your understanding and knowledge, and let words of peace and justice overtake you.
\p
\v 13 Be meek when listening to a word, so that you may understand. And offer a true response in wisdom.
\p
\v 14 If you understand, then answer your neighbor. But if you do not, then let your hand be over your mouth, so that you are not caught by an inept word, and then confounded.
\p
\v 15 Honor and glory are in the words of those who understand, yet truly, the tongue of the imprudent man is his undoing.
\p
\v 16 You should not be called a whisperer, and you should not be caught by your own tongue, and then confounded.
\p
\v 17 For confusion and remorse is upon a thief, and a wicked mark is upon the double-tongued; but for the whisperer, there is hatred and animosity and disgrace.
\p
\v 18 Justify the small and the great similarly.
\c 6
\cl Sirach 6
\p
\v 1 Do not be willing to become an enemy instead of a friend to your neighbor. For an evil man will inherit reproach and disgrace, as will every sinner who is envious and double-tongued.
\p
\v 2 You should not extol yourself, like a bull, in the thoughts of your soul, lest perhaps your strength may be cast down through foolishness,
\p
\v 3 which would consume your leaves, and destroy your fruit, and leave you behind like a dry tree in the desert.
\p
\v 4 For a wicked soul will destroy the one who has it. For it gladly provides enemies to him, and it will lead him to the fate of the impious.
\p
\v 5 A sweet word multiplies friends and mitigates enemies. And thankful words abound in a good man.
\p
\v 6 Allow many to be at peace with you, but allow one out of a thousand to be your counselor.
\p
\v 7 If you would obtain a friend, test him before you accept him, and do not trust him readily.
\p
\v 8 For there is a friend according to his own time, but he will not remain in the day of tribulation.
\p
\v 9 And there is a friend who can be turned to animosity. And there is a friend who will reveal hatred and ridicule and insults.
\p
\v 10 And there is a friend who is a companion at table, but he will not remain in a day of need.
\p
\v 11 A friend, if he remains steadfast, will be to you as you are to yourself, and he will act with faithfulness among those of your household.
\p
\v 12 If he humbles himself before you and hides himself from your face, you shall have a noble and harmonious friendship.
\p
\v 13 Distance yourself from your enemies, and pay attention to your friends.
\p
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong shelter, and whoever has found one has found a treasure.
\p
\v 15 Nothing is comparable to a faithful friend, and no weight of silver or gold is worth more than the goodness of his fidelity.
\p
\v 16 A faithful friend is a medicine for life and immortality; and those who fear the Lord will find one.
\p
\v 17 He who fears God will have a similar good friendship, because his friend will be like him.
\p
\v 18 Son, from your youth receive instruction, and then you will find wisdom, even to your grey hairs.
\p
\v 19 Approach wisdom like one who plows and sows, and then wait for her good fruits.
\p
\v 20 For in doing her work, you will labor a little, but you will soon eat from her produce.
\p
\v 21 How exceedingly harsh is wisdom to unlearned men! And so, the witless will not remain with her.
\p
\v 22 She will be to them like a great stone of trial, and they will cast her away from them without delay.
\p
\v 23 For the wisdom of doctrine is in accord with her name, and she is not manifest to many. But she continues with those by whom she is recognized, even in the sight of God.
\p
\v 24 Listen, son, and accept an understanding counsel, for you should not discard my advice.
\p
\v 25 Set your feet in her fetters and your neck in her chains.
\p
\v 26 Incline your shoulder, and carry her, for you will not be grieved by her bindings.
\p
\v 27 Approach her with all your soul, and serve her ways with all your strength.
\p
\v 28 Examine her, and she will be revealed to you, and when you have obtained her, you should not abandon her.
\p
\v 29 For, in the very end, you will find rest in her, and she will turn into your delight.
\p
\v 30 Then her fetters will be a strong protection and a firm foundation for you, and her chains will be a robe of glory.
\p
\v 31 For in her is the beauty of life, and her bindings are a healing bandage.
\p
\v 32 You will be clothed with her as with a robe of glory, and you will set her upon your head like a crown of rejoicing.
\p
\v 33 Son, if you heed me, you will learn. And if you adapt your mind, you will be wise.
\p
\v 34 If you incline your ear, you will receive doctrine. And if you love to listen, you will be wise.
\p
\v 35 Stand among the multitude of prudent elders, and join yourself to their wisdom from the heart, so that you may be able to hear every discourse about God, and so that the proverbs of praise may not flee from you.
\p
\v 36 And if you see a man of understanding, stand watch for him, and let your feet wear down the steps of his doors.
\p
\v 37 Set your thoughts on the precepts of God, and be entirely constant in his commandments. And he himself will give a heart to you, and the desire of wisdom will be given to you.
\c 7
\cl Sirach 7
\p
\v 1 Do not choose to do evil, and evil will not take hold of you.
\p
\v 2 Withdraw from the iniquitous, and evil will withdraw from you.
\p
\v 3 Son, do not sow evil in the furrows of injustice, and you will not reap them sevenfold.
\p
\v 4 Do not seek a role of leadership from the Lord, and do not seek a seat of honor from the king.
\p
\v 5 You should not justify yourself before God, for he is the Knower of hearts. And by no means should you wish to seem wise before the king.
\p
\v 6 Do not seek to become a judge, unless you have sufficient strength to shatter iniquities. Otherwise, you might fear the face of the powerful, and so establish a scandal within your integrity.
\p
\v 7 You should not sin against the multitude of a city, nor should you cast yourself against the people.
\p
\v 8 And you should not bind two sins together. For even in one sin, you will not go unpunished.
\p
\v 9 Do not be cowardly in your soul.
\p
\v 10 You should not be unwilling to beg, nor to give alms.
\p
\v 11 You should not say: “God will look with favor on the multitude of my gifts, and when I make an offering to the most high God, he will accept my gift.”
\p
\v 12 You should not ridicule a man in bitterness of soul. For there is One who humbles and who exalts: the all-seeing God.
\p
\v 13 Do not love a lie against your brother, nor should you act the same toward your friend.
\p
\v 14 Do not be willing to devise a lie of any kind. For the practice of lying is not good.
\p
\v 15 Do not choose to be verbose among a multitude of elders, and you should not repeat the words of your prayers.
\p
\v 16 You should not hate laborious works, nor the rustic life created by the Most High.
\p
\v 17 You should not consider yourself to be among the multitude of the undisciplined.
\p
\v 18 Remember wrath. For it will not be delayed.
\p
\v 19 Humble your spirit greatly. For the retribution against the flesh of the impious is with fire and worms.
\p
\v 20 Do not betray your friend for the sake of money, and you should not spurn your dearest brother for the sake of gold.
\p
\v 21 Do not choose to depart from a good and understanding wife, whom you have been allotted in the fear of the Lord. For the grace of her modesty is above gold.
\p
\v 22 You should not harm the servant whose works are honest, nor the hired hand who entrusts his life to you.
\p
\v 23 Let an understanding servant be loved by you like your own soul. You should not cheat him out of freedom, nor abandon him to destitution.
\p
\v 24 Are cattle yours? Tend to them. And if they are useful, let them remain with you.
\p
\v 25 Are sons yours? Instruct them, and bow them down from their childhood.
\p
\v 26 Are daughters yours? Watch over their bodies. And you should not display a light-hearted attitude toward them.\f + \fr 7:26 \ft The word ‘hilarem’ is not mere cheerfulness, but has more of a negative connotation, something akin to silly or fatuous, or the like.\f*
\p

\p
\v 9 Praise is not beautiful in the mouth of a sinner.
\p
\v 10 For wisdom was sent from God. And praise will stand before the wisdom of God, and praise will abound in the mouths of the faithful, and the sovereign Lord will give praise to wisdom.
\p
\v 11 You should not say: “It is because of God that wisdom is absent.” For you should not do what he detests.
\p
\v 12 You should not say: “He has led me astray.” For the impious are of no use to him.
\p
\v 13 The Lord hates all abominable error, and those who fear him will not love such things.

\v 15 He added his commandments and precepts.
\p
\v 16 If you choose to keep the commandments, and if, having chosen them, you fulfill them with perpetual fidelity, they will preserve you.

\p
\v 1 You should not rejoice in impious children, if they are successful; nor should you take delight in them, if the fear of God is not in them.
\p
\v 2 You should not approve of their life, nor should you look with favor on their labors.
\p
\v 3 For one child who fears God is better than one thousand impious children.

\v 9 And he did not spare the place of Lot’s sojourn, and he abhorred them because of the arrogance of their words.
\p
\v 10 He did not take pity on them, destroying an entire people, who even extolled themselves concerning their sins.
\p
\v 11 And this was so with six hundred thousand men, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. And if even a single obstinate person had escaped unpunished, it would be a wonder.
\p
\v 12 For mercy and wrath are with him. He is powerful in forgiveness, and he pours forth wrath.
\p
\v 13 As is his mercy, so also is his correction; he judges a man according to his works.

\v 14 The sinner, in his violations, will not escape; but the patience of the One who shows mercy will not be diminished.
\p
\v 15 Every mercy will make a place for each man, according to the merit of his works, and according to the understanding of his sojourn.
\p
\v 16 You should not say: “I am hidden from God,” or, “Who, from on high, will take note of me?”
\p
\v 17 or, “Among a great number of people, I will not be noticed. For what is my soul amid such an immense creation?”
\p
\v 18 Behold: the heavens, and the heaven of the heavens, the abyss, and the entire earth, and the things that are within these, will be shaken by his gaze,

\p
\v 20 And concerning all these things, the heart is without understanding; but every heart is understood by him.
\p
\v 21 And who will understand his ways, or the tempest, which no eye of man will see?
\p
\v 22 For many of his works are concealed. But who will announce the works of his justice? Or who will endure them? For the testament is far from some persons, and the examination of each thing is in its end.

\p
\v 24 Listen to me, son, and learn the discipline of understanding, and attend to my words in your heart.
\p
\v 25 And I will speak with equity about discipline, and I will strive to announce wisdom. So attend to my words in your heart, and I will speak with equity of spirit, about the virtues that God has set within his works from the beginning, and I will announce his knowledge in truth.
\p
\v 26 With the judgment of God, his works have been done from the beginning; and from their institution, he himself distinguished their parts and set their beginnings, in their kinds.

\v 5 He created from him a helper, similar to himself. He gave them counsel, and language, and sight, and hearing, and a heart, in order to think. And he filled them with the discipline of understanding.
\p
\v 6 He created within them the knowledge of the spirit. He filled their heart with understanding, and he showed them both good and evil.
\p
\v 7 He set his eye upon their hearts, to reveal to them the greatness of his works,
\p
\v 8 so that they might highly praise the name of sanctification, and give glory to his wonders, so that they might declare the greatness of his works.
\p
\v 9 In addition, he gave them discipline and the law of life, as their inheritance.
\p
\v 10 He established an eternal covenant with them, and he revealed to them his justice and judgments.
\p
\v 11 And their eye saw the greatness of his honor, and their ears heard the honor of his voice, and he said to them: “Beware of all iniquity.”

\v 13 Their ways are always in his sight; they are not hidden from his eyes.

\v 14 Over each and every people, he has appointed a ruler.
\p
\v 15 And Israel was made to be the manifest portion of God.
\p
\v 16 And in the sight of God, all their works are like the sun. And his eyes, without ceasing, inspect their ways.

\v 17 The covenants are not hidden by their iniquity, and all their iniquities are in the sight of God.

\v 18 The almsgiving of a man is like a seal upon him, which will guard the grace of a man like the pupil of an eye.
\p
\v 19 And afterward, it will rise up and repay them their reward, each one upon his head, and it will return to the hidden places of the earth.
\p
\v 20 Now, to the repentant, he has given the way of justice, and he has strengthened those lacking in patience, and he has fastened them to a destiny of truth.

\v 18 Sand, and salt, and an iron weight are each easier to bear than an imprudent man, who is both foolish and impious.
\p
\v 19 A bundle of wood strapped together in the foundation of a building will not be loosened. And similar is the heart that has been strengthened by thoughtful counsel.
\p
\v 20 The thoughts of one who is understanding will not be corrupted by fear in any situation.
\p
\v 21 Just as chaff in a high place, or a wall made of mortar without stones set within, will not continue against the face of the wind,\f + \fr 22:21 \ft The word ‘pali’ refers to chaff, not to a pole or a fence; for some reason the Latin puts the word in the second declension (masculine), rather than in the first declension (feminine). The phrase ‘cæmenta sine impensa posita’ refers to a wall, which would usually be made of stones and mortar, but which is made ‘sine impensa posita’ without (sine) heavy or weighed things (impensa), i.e. stones, set within it (posita).\f*
\p
\v 22 so also a timid heart, and the thoughts of the senseless, will not withstand the forcefulness of fear.
\p
\v 23 Despite a cowardly heart, the thoughts of the foolish will not fear any situation; yet neither will one who continues always in the precepts of God.\f + \fr 22:23 \ft The foolish man does not think that his nervous heart will dread any situation; he reaches this incorrect conclusion because of his foolishness. But those who keep the precepts of God truly do not need to dread any situation.\f*
\p
\v 24 He who jabs an eye produces tears. And he who jabs the heart produces understanding.
\p
\v 25 He who throws a stone at birds will drive them away. So also, he who accuses his friend dissolves the friendship.
\p
\v 26 But if you have drawn a sword against a friend, you should not despair; for there may be a way back.
\p
\v 27 If you have opened a harsh mouth against a friend, you should not fear; for there may be a reconciliation. However, if there are accusations, or abuse, or arrogance, or the revealing of secrets, or a wound from deceitfulness, in all these cases, a friend will flee away.
\p
\v 28 Hold to faithfulness with a friend in his poverty, so that you may also rejoice in his prosperity.
\p
\v 29 In the time of his tribulation, remain faithful to him, so that you may also be an heir with him in his inheritance.
\p
\v 30 Just as the steam from an oven, or the smoke from a fire, rises up before a flame, so also do curses and insults and threats rise up before bloodshed.
\p
\v 31 I shall not be ashamed to greet a friend, nor shall I hide myself from his face. And if misfortunes befall me because of him, I will endure.
\p
\v 32 Anyone who hears of this will be wary around him.
\p
\v 33 Who will provide a keeper for my mouth, and a reliable seal over my lips, so that I may not fall because of them, and so that my tongue does not destroy me?
\c 23
\cl Sirach 23
\p
\v 1 Lord, Father and Ruler of my life: may you not abandon me to their counsel, nor permit me to fall by them.
\p
\v 2 They would impose scourges over my thoughts and over the discipline of wisdom in my heart. And they would not spare me from their ignorances, nor would they allow their own offenses to become apparent.
\p
\v 3 And they intend that my ignorances would increase, and my offenses be multiplied, and my sins abound. And so I would fall in the sight of my adversaries, and be rejoiced over by my enemy.
\p
\v 4 Lord, Father and God of my life: may you not abandon me to their plans.
\p
\v 5 Do not leave me with the haughtiness of my eyes. And avert all desire from me.
\p
\v 6 Take the desire of the body from me, and do not allow sexual desire to take hold of me, and do not permit an irreverent and senseless mind within me.
\p
\v 7 O sons: listen to the doctrine of my mouth. For those who observe it will not perish by the lips, nor be scandalized into wicked works.
\p
\v 8 A sinner is held by his own emptiness. And the arrogant and those who speak evil will be scandalized by these things.
\p
\v 9 Do not allow your mouth to become accustomed to swearing oaths. For in this, there are many pitfalls.
\p
\v 10 Truly, do not allow the naming of God to be continually in your mouth, and do not treat as if common the names of the holy ones. For you will not escape punishment by them.
\p
\v 11 Just as a servant, continually interrogated, will not be without a bruise, so everyone who swears oaths and takes God’s name will not be entirely free from sin.
\p
\v 12 A man who swears many oaths will be filled with iniquity, and scourges will not depart from his house.
\p
\v 13 And if he fails to fulfill it, his offense will be over him, and if he pretends he fulfilled it, he offends doubly.
\p
\v 14 And if he swears an oath insincerely, he will not be justified. For his house will be filled with retribution for him.
\p
\v 15 There is yet another kind of talk which faces death; let it not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.
\p
\v 16 For all these things will be taken away from the merciful, and they shall not wallow in offenses.
\p
\v 17 Do not allow your mouth to become accustomed to undisciplined speech. For in this, there is the sin of words.
\p
\v 18 When you sit in the midst of great men, remember your father and mother.
\p
\v 19 Otherwise, God may forget you, when you are in their sight, and then you would be repeatedly ridiculed and would suffer disgrace, and you might wish that you had never been born, and you might curse the day of your nativity.
\p
\v 20 The man who is accustomed to disgraceful words will not accept instruction, all the days of his life.
\p
\v 21 Two kinds of persons abound in sins, and a third adds wrath and perdition.
\p
\v 22 A desirous soul is like a burning fire, it will not be quenched, until it devours something.
\p
\v 23 And a man who is wicked in the desires of his flesh will not desist until he has kindled a fire.
\p
\v 24 To a man of fornication, all bread is sweet; he will not tire of transgression, to the very end.
\p
\v 25 Every man who transgresses his own bed has contempt for his own soul. And so he says: “Who can see me?
\p
\v 26 Darkness surrounds me, and the walls enclose me, and no one catches sight of me. Whom should I fear? The Most High will not remember my offenses.”
\p
\v 27 And he does not understand that God’s eye sees all things. For fear within a man such as this drives away from him both the fear of God and the eyes of those men who fear God.
\p
\v 28 And he does not acknowledge that the eyes of the Lord are much brighter than the sun, keeping watch over all the ways of men, even to the depths of the abyss, and gazing into the hearts of men, even to the most hidden parts.
\p
\v 29 For all things, before they were created, were known to the Lord God. And even after their completion, he beholds all things.
\p
\v 30 This man will be punished in the streets of the city, and he will be chased like a young horse. And in a place that he does not suspect, he will be captured.
\p
\v 31 And because he did not understand the fear of the Lord, he will be in disgrace before all men,
\p
\v 32 as will be every woman, too, who abandons her husband and establishes an inheritance by marriage to another man.
\p
\v 33 For first, she was unbelieving of the law of the Most High. Second, she offended against her husband. Third, she fornicated by adultery, and so established her children by another man.
\p
\v 34 This woman will be led into the assembly, and she will be stared at by her children.
\p
\v 35 Her children will not take root, and her branches will not produce fruit.
\p
\v 36 She will leave behind her memory as a curse, and her infamy will not be wiped away.
\p
\v 37 And those who are left behind will acknowledge that there is nothing better than the fear of God, and that there is nothing sweeter than to have respect for the commandments of the Lord.
\p
\v 38 It is a great glory to follow the Lord. For length of days will be received from him.
\c 24
\cl Sirach 24
\p
\v 1 Wisdom will praise her own mind, and she will be honored by God, and she will be glorified in the midst of her people.
\p
\v 2 And she will open her mouth in the churches of the Most High, and she will be glorified in the sight of his virtue.
\p
\v 3 And in the midst of her own people, she will be exalted. And she will be admired by the holy assembly.
\p
\v 4 And she will have praise within the multitude of the elect. And she will be blessed among the blessed. And she will say:
\p
\v 5 “I went forth from the mouth of the Most High, as the first-born before all creatures.
\p
\v 6 I caused an unfailing light to arise in the heavens. And I covered all the earth like a cloud.
\p
\v 7 I lived in the highest places, and my throne is in the pillar of a cloud.
\p
\v 8 I alone have encompassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated to the depths of the abyss, and have walked upon the waves of the sea,
\p
\v 9 and have stood upon the whole earth. And among every people,
\p
\v 10 and in every nation, I have held primacy.
\p
\v 11 And by virtue, I have tread upon the hearts of all, the great and the lowly. And I have sought my rest in all of them. And I will continue, as the inheritance of the Lord.
\p
\v 12 Then the Creator of all things instructed and spoke with me. And the One who created me rested in my tabernacle.
\p
\v 13 And he said to me: ‘Let your dwelling place be with Jacob, and let your inheritance be in Israel, for you shall take root among my elect.’
\p
\v 14 From the beginning, and before the world, I was created. And even unto the future world, I will not cease to exist. For I have ministered before him in the holy habitation.
\p
\v 15 And in this way, I was established in Zion. And likewise, in the holy city, I found rest. And my authority was in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 16 And I took root among an honorable people, within the portion of my God, within his inheritance. And so my abode is in the full assembly of the saints.
\p
\v 17 I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanon and like a cypress on Mount Zion.
\p
\v 18 I was exalted like a palm tree in Kadesh and like a rose bush in Jericho.
\p
\v 19 I was exalted like a beautiful olive tree in the plains, and like a sycamore tree beside the waters along a wide road.
\p
\v 20 I gave off an aromatic fragrance like cinnamon or balsam. I produced a sweet odor like the best myrrh.
\p
\v 21 And I perfumed my dwelling place with sweet gum, and aromatic resin, and flower petals, and aloe, as well as the finest cedar from Lebanon. And my fragrance is like undiluted balsam.\f + \fr 24:21 \ft The word ‘ungula’ literally means claw or talon, but is also used in botany to refer to the claw-shaped base of certain flower petals. Galbanum is a type of aromatic resin. Sweet gum is the closest translation which preserves the figurative meaning of the text and also is easily understandable in English. Challoner translates ‘gutta’ (lit. a droplet) as aloe. The phrase ‘Libanus non incisus’ refers to cedar wood from Lebanon (see previous verse). The phrase ‘non incisus’ means uncut, but certainly it is not an uncut tree; rather, it is an expression referring to the excellence of the cedar wood.\f*
\p
\v 22 I have extended my branches like a terebinth tree, and my branches are of honor and grace.
\p
\v 23 Like the vine, I have born the fruit of a sweet fragrance. And my flowers are the fruit of honor and integrity.
\p
\v 24 I am the mother of the beauty of love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.
\p
\v 25 All grace of the way and of the truth is in me. All hope of life and of virtue is in me.
\p
\v 26 Journey toward me, all you who desire me, and be filled by my harvest.
\p
\v 27 For my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance is better than honey and the honeycomb.
\p
\v 28 My memory is for the generations of all ages.
\p
\v 29 Whoever consumes me will hunger still. And whoever drinks me will thirst still.
\p
\v 30 Whoever listens to me will not be confounded. And whoever acts in me will not sin.
\p
\v 31 Whoever elucidates me will have eternal life.”
\p
\v 32 All this is a book of life, and a covenant of the Most High, and an acknowledgement of truth.
\p
\v 33 Moses commanded the law by the precepts of justice, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.

\p
\v 35 It is he who fulfills wisdom, like the Phison river and the Tigris river in the first days.
\p
\v 36 It is he who fulfills understanding, like the river Euphrates. It is he who multiplies understanding, like the river Jordan in the time of the harvest.
\p
\v 37 He sends forth discipline like the light, and he stands forth like the river Gehon in the time of the vintage.\f + \fr 24:37 \ft The Greek and Latin read ‘like the light’ and the Hebrew and Neo-Vulgate read ‘like the Nile’.\f*

\p
\v 41 I am like a brook leading to a river of immense waters. I am like a channel flowing from a river. And I went forth from Paradise like an aqueduct.
\p
\v 42 I said: I will irrigate my garden of plantings, and I will thoroughly water the fruits of my field.
\p
\v 43 And behold, my brook became overflowing, and my river drew near to the sea.
\p
\v 44 For I illuminate doctrine to all, like the first light. And I will announce doctrine, even to those who are far away.
\p
\v 45 I will reach to all the lower parts of the earth, and I will gaze upon all who sleep, and I will illuminate all who hope in the Lord.

\c 25
\cl Sirach 25
\p
\v 1 My spirit is pleased with three things; these are approved in the sight of God and men:
\p
\v 2 the harmony of brothers, and the love of neighbors, and a husband and wife agreeing well together.
\p
\v 3 My soul hates three kinds of things; and I am greatly distressed over their souls:
\p
\v 4 an arrogant pauper, a wealthy liar, a foolish and senseless elder.
\p
\v 5 The things that you have not obtained in your youth, how will you find them in your old age?
\p
\v 6 How beautiful it is for a grey head to have judgment, and for elders to know counsel!
\p
\v 7 How beautiful it is for those who are aged to have wisdom, and for those who are honored to have understanding and counsel!
\p
\v 8 Great experience is the crown of the aged, and the fear of God is their glory.
\p
\v 9 I have magnified nine things, overlooked by the heart; and a tenth, I will declare to men with my tongue:
\p
\v 10 a man who finds joy in his children, and one who lives to see the undoing of his enemies.
\p
\v 11 Blessed is he who lives with a wise wife, and he who has not slipped with his tongue, and he who has not served those unworthy of himself.
\p
\v 12 Blessed is he who finds a true friend, and he who describes justice to an attentive ear.
\p
\v 13 How great is he who finds wisdom and knowledge! But there is no one above him who fears the Lord.
\p
\v 14 The fear of God has set itself above all things.
\p
\v 15 Blessed is the man to whom it has been given to have the fear of God. He who holds to it, to whom can he be compared?
\p
\v 16 The fear of God is the beginning of his love; and the beginning of faith has been joined closely to the same.
\p
\v 17 The sadness of the heart is every wound. And the wickedness of a wife is every malice.
\p
\v 18 And a man will choose any wound, but the wound of the heart,
\p
\v 19 and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a wife,
\p
\v 20 and any obstacle, but the obstacle of those who hate him,
\p
\v 21 and any vindication, but the vindication of his enemies.
\p
\v 22 There is no head worse than the head of a serpent,\f + \fr 25:22 \ft The Greek and Latin read ‘head’ and the Hebrew and Neo-Vulgate read ‘poison’.\f*
\p
\v 23 and there is no anger above the anger of a wife. It would be more agreeable to abide with a lion or a dragon, than to live with a wicked wife.
\p
\v 24 A wicked wife changes her face. And she darkens her countenance like a bear. And she displays it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbors,
\p
\v 25 her husband groans, and hearing of this, he sighs a little.
\p
\v 26 All malice is brief compared to the malice of a wife. Let the fate of sinners fall upon her!
\p
\v 27 As climbing over sand is to the feet of the aged, so is a talkative wife to a quiet man.
\p
\v 28 You should not favor a woman’s beauty, and you should not desire a wife for her beauty.
\p
\v 29 The anger and disrespect and shame from a wife can be great.
\p
\v 30 The wife, if she has primacy, is set against her husband.
\p
\v 31 A wicked wife debases the heart, and saddens the face, and wounds the heart.
\p
\v 32 A wife who does not make her husband happy enfeebles the hands and weakens the knees.
\p
\v 33 The beginning of sin came from a woman; and through her, we all die.
\p
\v 34 You should not provide an exit to your water, not even a little; nor should you give permission for a wicked wife to exceed the limit.\f + \fr 25:34 \ft The word ‘prodeundi’ usually refers to travel beyond a certain point; but here it is used figuratively, to mean exceeding a certain limit.\f*
\p
\v 35 If she will not walk at your hand, she will confound you in the sight of your enemies.
\p
\v 36 Tear her away from your body, lest she abuse you continually.
\c 26
\cl Sirach 26
\p
\v 1 Blessed is the husband of a good wife. For the number of his years is doubled.
\p
\v 2 A good wife delights her husband, and she will fill up the years of his life with peace.
\p
\v 3 A good wife is a good portion. She will be given the portion of those who fear God, like a man who has done good deeds.
\p
\v 4 But, rich or poor, with a good heart, his countenance will be cheerful at all times.
\p
\v 5 Of three things, my heart has been afraid, and at a fourth, my face has shown dread:
\p
\v 6 an accusation made by a city, and the gathering of a mob,
\p
\v 7 and a deceitful false accusation. All these are more grievous than death.
\p
\v 8 A jealous wife is a grief and a mourning to the heart.
\p
\v 9 In a jealous wife, there is a scourge of the tongue, which communicates with everyone.
\p
\v 10 Like a yoke of oxen being provoked, so also is a wicked wife. He who has hold of her is like one who has taken hold of a scorpion.
\p
\v 11 An inebriated wife is a great wrath. And her disgrace and indecency will not be covered.
\p
\v 12 The fornication of a wife will become known by the haughtiness of her eyes and by her eyelids.
\p
\v 13 So that her daughter will not also turn away, keep a strict watch; otherwise, having found an opportunity, she may enjoy herself.
\p
\v 14 Be wary of the irreverence of her eyes, and you should not wonder if she might disregard you.
\p
\v 15 Like a thirsty traveler, she will open her mouth to the fountain, and she will drink from every water nearby, and she will sit down beside every fencepost, and she will open her quiver to every arrow, until she becomes weary.
\p
\v 16 The grace of an attentive wife will delight her husband, and will fatten his bones.
\p
\v 17 Her discipline is a gift from God.
\p
\v 18 Such is an understanding and quiet wife. For there is no substitution for a well-instructed soul.
\p
\v 19 A holy and contrite wife is grace upon grace.
\p
\v 20 And no amount of money is equal to the value of a soul with self-restraint.
\p
\v 21 Like the sun rising over the world in the high places of God, so the beauty of a good wife is the adornment of her house.
\p
\v 22 Like a lamp shining atop a holy lampstand, so is the beauty of a face in the mature stage of life.
\p
\v 23 Like golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet of a mature wife upon the soles of her feet.
\p
\v 24 Like everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so are the commandments of God in the heart of a holy wife.
\p
\v 25 By two things, my heart is greatly saddened, and at a third, anger overwhelms me:
\p
\v 26 a man of war failing because of dire need, and an understanding man treated with contempt,
\p
\v 27 and anyone who crosses over from justice to sin. God has prepared such a one for the spear.
\p
\v 28 Two kinds of things have seemed difficult and dangerous to me: a merchant will not be easily freed from his negligence, and a shopkeeper will not be justified by the sins of his lips.
\c 27
\cl Sirach 27
\p
\v 1 Because of need, many have sinned. And whoever seeks to be enriched, averts his eye.
\p
\v 2 Like a post fixed in the middle of adjoining stones, so also will sin become wedged between selling and buying.
\p
\v 3 Sin will be crushed with the one who sins.
\p
\v 4 If you do not hold yourself steadfastly to the fear of the Lord, your house will be quickly overthrown.
\p
\v 5 Just as the dust remains when one shakes a sieve, so will the doubt of a man remain in his thoughts.
\p
\v 6 The furnace tests the potter’s vessels, and the trial of the tribulation tests just men.
\p
\v 7 As the pruning of a tree reveals its fruit, so does a word reveal the thoughts in the heart of a man.
\p
\v 8 You should not praise a man before he speaks; for such is the testing of men.
\p
\v 9 If you pursue justice, you will obtain it. And you will be clothed with justice, as with a long robe of honor. And you will live with justice. And justice will protect you continually. And on the day of reckoning, you will find a strong foundation.
\p
\v 10 Birds flock to their own kind. And truth will return to those who practice it.
\p
\v 11 The lion lies in wait for its prey continually. So also do sins lie in wait for those who work iniquity.
\p
\v 12 A holy man persists in wisdom like the sun. But a senseless man changes like the moon.
\p
\v 13 In the midst of the senseless, retain a word for the proper time. But be continually in the midst of those who are thoughtful.
\p
\v 14 The discussions of sinners are hateful, and their laughter is a delight in sin.
\p
\v 15 The speech that swears many oaths will cause the hair of the head to stand upright; and its irreverence will cause the ears to be blocked.
\p
\v 16 The shedding of blood is in the quarrels of the arrogant; and their evil talk is grievous to hear.
\p
\v 17 Whoever discloses the secret of a friend breaks faith; and he will not find a friend for his soul.
\p
\v 18 Love your neighbor, and be united with him faithfully.
\p
\v 19 But if you disclose his secrets, you should not continue to follow after him.
\p
\v 20 For like a man who destroys his friend, so also is he who destroys the friendship of his neighbor.
\p
\v 21 And like someone releasing a bird from his hand, so have you abandoned your neighbor, and you will not obtain him again.
\p
\v 22 You should no longer seek him, for he is now far away; he has fled like a roe-deer from a snare. For his soul has been wounded.
\p
\v 23 You will no longer be able to bind his wound. For there may be a reconciliation from cursing.
\p
\v 24 But to disclose the secrets of a friend is the hopeless act of an unhappy soul.
\p
\v 25 One who winks with the eye fabricates iniquity, and no one will cast him aside.
\p
\v 26 In the sight of your eyes, he will sweeten his mouth, and he will admire your talk. But at the very end, he will pervert his mouth, and he will offer a scandal from your own words.
\p
\v 27 I have hated many things, but I have not done as he has done, and the Lord will hate him.
\p
\v 28 Whoever throws a stone straight up will find that it falls on his own head. And a deceitful wound will return to wound the deceitful.
\p
\v 29 And whoever digs a pit will fall into it. And whoever positions a stone against his neighbor will stumble over it. And whoever lays a trap for another will perish by it.
\p
\v 30 Whoever sets in motion a wicked plan will find that it rolls back over him, and he will not know from which direction it will arrive.
\p
\v 31 Mockery and derision are of the arrogant, and vengeance will lie in wait for them, like a lion.
\p
\v 32 Whoever enjoys the fall of the just will perish in a snare, and grief will consume them before they die.

\c 28
\cl Sirach 28
\p
\v 1 Whoever wishes for vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely be attentive to his sins.
\p
\v 2 Forgive your neighbor, if he has harmed you, and then your sins will be forgiven you when you pray.
\p
\v 3 A man holds on to anger against another man, and does he then seek a remedy from God?
\p
\v 4 He has no mercy on a man like himself, and does he then entreat for his own sins?
\p
\v 5 He who is but flesh holds on to anger, and does he then request forgiveness from God? Who can obtain pardon for his sins in this way?
\p
\v 6 Remember your very end, and let animosities cease.
\p
\v 7 For corruption and death are suspended over his commandments.
\p
\v 8 Remember the fear of God, and do not be angry with your neighbor.
\p
\v 9 Remember the covenant of the Most High, and overlook the ignorant offenses of your neighbor.
\p
\v 10 Refrain from strife, and you will diminish your sins.
\p
\v 11 For an ill-tempered man enflames conflict, and a sinful man troubles his friends, and he casts hostility into the midst of those who have peace.
\p
\v 12 For the fire burns according to the wood of the forest. And the anger of a man burns according to the strength of the man. And according to his resources, he will exalt his anger.
\p
\v 13 A hasty contention kindles a fire. And a hasty quarrel sheds blood. And an accusatory tongue brings death.
\p
\v 14 If you blow on a spark, it will increase to a fire. But if you spit on it, it will be extinguished. Both of these proceed from the mouth.
\p
\v 15 The double-tongued whisperer is accursed. For he has disturbed many who had peace.
\p
\v 16 A third tongue has stirred up many, and has scattered them from nation to nation.
\p
\v 17 It has destroyed the walled cities of the wealthy, and has undermined the houses of the great.
\p
\v 18 It has cut down the virtues of the peoples, and has broken strong nations.
\p
\v 19 A third tongue has cast down virtuous women, and has deprived them of their labors.
\p
\v 20 Whoever favors it will not have rest, nor will he have a friend in whom he may find peace.
\p
\v 21 The wound of a whip causes a bruise, but the wound of the tongue will crush the bones.
\p
\v 22 Many have fallen by the mouth of the sword, but not as many as have perished by their own tongue.
\p
\v 23 Blessed is he who is protected from a wicked tongue, who has not gone over to its wrath, and has not pulled its yoke, and has not been bound by its chains.
\p
\v 24 For its yoke is a yoke of iron. And its chains are chains of brass.
\p

\v 1 He shows mercy who lends to his neighbor, for he keeps the commandments by strengthening him.
\p
\v 2 Lend to your neighbor in his time of need, and receive it again from your neighbor in his time.
\p
\v 3 Keep your word, and act faithfully with him, and then you will find whatever you need in every time.
\p
\v 4 Many have treated a loan like found money, and they offered trouble to those who helped them.
\p
\v 5 Until they receive, they kiss the hands of the giver, and they humble their voice in promises.
\p
\v 6 But at the time of repayment, they will ask for more time, and they will speak annoying and complaining words, and they will make excuses for the time.
\p
\v 7 Then, if he is able to repay, he will turn away. He will pay barely one half, and he will consider it as if he had found it.
\p
\v 8 But if not, then he will defraud him of his money, and he will have him as an enemy without cause.
\p
\v 9 And he will repay him with accusations and curses, and he will repay him with contempt, instead of with honor and kindness.
\p
\v 10 Many have refused to lend, not because of wickedness, but because they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.
\p
\v 11 Yet truly, be more steadfast toward the humble, and you should not delay in acts of mercy toward them.
\p
\v 12 Assist the poor because of the commandment. And you should not send him away empty because of his dire need.
\p
\v 13 Lose your money to your brother and your friend. For you should not hide it under a stone to be lost.
\p
\v 14 Let your treasure be in the precepts of the Most High, and it will benefit you more than gold.

\v 15 Store your alms in the hearts of the poor, and it will obtain help for you against all evil.

\p
\v 23 A wicked promise has destroyed many who had good intentions, and has tossed them like a wave on the ocean.
\p
\v 24 It has caused powerful men to travel around, and they have wandered amid foreign nations.
\p
\v 25 A sinner transgressing the commandment of the Lord will fall into a wicked promise. And he who undertakes many things will fall into judgment.
\p
\v 26 Help your neighbor to recover according to your ability, but attend to yourself, lest you also fall.
\p
\v 27 The primary need in a man’s life is water and bread, and clothing, and a house to protect modesty.

\p
\v 29 Let yourself be pleased with little instead of much, and you will not hear the reproach of being away from home.
\p
\v 30 It is a wicked life to go from house to house as a guest. For wherever he is a guest, he will not act confidently, nor open his mouth.
\p
\v 31 He will entertain, and feed, and give drink to the ungrateful, and beyond this, he will listen to bitter words:
\p
\v 32 “Go, my guest, and set the table, and let others eat from what you have in your hand.”
\p
\v 33 “Depart from the honored face of my friends. For it has become necessary for my house to host my brother instead.”

\v 5 So may they know you, as we also have known you. For there is no God apart from you, O Lord.
\p
\v 6 Renew your signs, and work new wonders.

\v 20 The belly can devour any food, yet one meal is better than another.

\p
\v 24 The beauty of a wife cheers the face of her husband, and rises above his desire, above all the desires of man.

\v 25 If she offers healing words, then she both comforts and shows mercy; and so her husband is not like other men.

\v 26 He who holds to a good wife establishes a possession. She is a helper in agreement with him, and she is a pillar of rest.

\v 27 Where there is no hedge, a possession will be trampled. And where there is no wife, he will mourn her absence.

\cl Sirach 37
\p
\v 1 Every friend will say: “I also am a close friend.” But there is a friend who is a friend in name only. Is this not a grief even unto death?
\p
\v 2 But a companion and friend may turn into an enemy.
\p
\v 3 O wicked presumption! From what were you created that you would cover the dry land with your malice and deceitfulness?
\p
\v 4 A companion may rejoice with his friend in good times, but in a time of tribulation, he will be an adversary.
\p
\v 5 There is a companion who commiserates with a friend for the sake of the stomach, but he will shield himself from the enemy.
\p
\v 6 You should not forget your friend in your soul, and you should not be unmindful of him in your wealth.
\p
\v 7 Do not choose to consult with someone who waits in ambush for you. And hide your counsel from those who rival you.
\p
\v 8 Every counselor offers advice, but some are counselors only for themselves.
\p
\v 9 Guard your soul from a counselor. And know beforehand what his interests are. For he will form thoughts from his own soul.
\p
\v 10 Otherwise, he may set a signpost in the ground, and he may say to you:
\p
\v 11 “Your own way is good.” But then he will stand at a distance to see what befalls you.
\p
\v 12 Do not discuss holiness with an irreligious man, nor justice with one who is unjust. You should not speak with a woman about her who is a rival, nor with a coward about war, nor with a merchant about exaggeration, nor with a buyer about selling, nor with a spiteful man about giving thanks,\f + \fr 37:12 \ft In the context of a merchant trying to sell his wares, the word ‘trajectione’ refers to exaggeration, to advertising hyperbole.\f*

\p
\v 14 nor with a worker hired for a year about the end of the year, nor with a lazy servant about great works. You should pay no heed to these persons in any matter of counsel.
\p
\v 15 But be continually with a holy man, with anyone whom you know to observe the fear of God,
\p
\v 16 whose soul is in agreement with your own soul, and who, when you falter in the dark, will share your sorrows.
\p
\v 17 And establish a heart of good counsel within yourself. For there is nothing of greater usefulness to you than this.\f + \fr 37:17 \ft In this context, ‘delaturam’ does not refer to a fear of detraction if one does not mourn, but to a sinking down into bitterness, willingly, for a day or so, and then accepting consolation.\f*
\p
\v 18 At any time, the soul of a holy man declares more truths than seven vigilant watchmen sitting in a high place.\f + \fr 37:18 \ft In this context ‘detractionem’ does not refer to slander or to the fear of detraction, but to a removal, that is, to a loss of a human person created by God. The reason for mourning is not fear of accusation, but because of the loss to the world.\f*
\p
\v 19 But concerning all things, pray to the Most High, so that he may direct your way in truth.
\p
\v 20 In all your works, let a true word precede you, with steadfast counsel before every deed.
\p
\v 21 A wicked word can change the heart. From the heart four kinds of things arise: good and evil, life and death. And the tongue is continually their ruler. There is a man who is an astute teacher of many, and yet this is useless to his own soul.
\p
\v 22 A man of experience has taught many, and this is pleasant to his own soul.
\p
\v 23 Whoever speaks mere rhetoric is hateful; he will be deceived in every matter.
\p
\v 24 Grace is not given to him from the Lord. For he has been deprived of all wisdom.
\p
\v 25 There is a wise man who is wise within his own soul, and the fruit of his understanding is praiseworthy.
\p
\v 26 A wise man instructs his own people, and the fruit of his understanding is faithful.
\p
\v 27 A wise man will be filled with blessings, and those who see will praise him.
\p
\v 28 The life of a man is in the number of his days. But the days of Israel are innumerable.
\p
\v 29 A wise man will inherit honor among the people, and his name will live in eternity.
\p
\v 30 Son, test your own mind in your life, and if it is lacking, you should not give it authority.
\p
\v 31 For not all things are fitting for all persons, and not every kind of thing is agreeable to every soul.
\p
\v 32 Do not choose to be eager during any feast, and you should not act with excess toward any food.
\p
\v 33 For in excessive eating there will be infirmity, and gluttony will continue even unto illness.

\v 4 The Most High has created medicines from the earth, and a prudent man will not abhor them.
\p
\v 5 Was not bitter water made sweet with wood?
\p
\v 6 The benefits of these things is recognized by men, and the Most High has given this knowledge to men, so that he may be honored in his wonders.
\p
\v 7 By these things, he will cure or mitigate their suffering, and the pharmacist will make soothing ointments, and he will form healing medicines, and there will be no end to his works.
\p
\v 8 For the peace of God is upon the surface of the earth.
\p
\v 9 Son, in your infirmity, you should not neglect yourself, but pray to the Lord, and he will cure you.

\v 15 He who sins in the sight of the One who made him will fall into the hands of the physician.
\p
\v 16 Son, shed tears over the dead, and begin to weep, as if you had suffered dreadfully. And according to judgment, cover his body, and you should not neglect his burial.
\p
\v 17 And though you will sink down into bitterness, bear his mourning for one day, and then be consoled in your sadness.
\p
\v 18 And carry out his mourning, according to his merit, for one or two days because of this loss.
\p
\v 19 Yet sadness hastens death and overwhelms strength, and the sorrow of the heart bows down the neck.
\p
\v 20 When one is taken away, sorrow remains. But the resources of a destitute man is found in his heart.
\p
\v 21 You should not give your heart over to sadness, but push it away from you. And remember the very end.
\p
\v 22 Do not be willing to forget this; for there is no turning back. Otherwise, it will not benefit you, and you will cause great harm to yourself.
\p
\v 23 Call to mind my judgment. For so shall it be for you also. Yesterday is mine, and today is yours.

\v 26 With what wisdom will someone be filled who holds the plow, and who boasts of the cattle prod that drives the oxen forward, and who is occupied in these labors, and whose only conversation is about the offspring of bulls?
\p
\v 27 He will give his mind over to the plowing of furrows, and his vigilance to the fattening of the cows.
\p
\v 28 Similarly, every craftsman and artisan, who crafts in the night as well as in the day, who sculpts graven seals, and who, by his diligence, varies the image, will give his mind over to the likeness of the image. And he will complete the work by his vigilance.
\p
\v 29 The blacksmith, sitting by his anvil and considering a work of iron, is similar. The steam from the fire singes his flesh, and he struggles against the heat of the furnace.
\p
\v 30 The voice of the hammer is ever in his ears, and his eye is upon the pattern of the ironwork.
\p

\p
\v 34 He will give his heart over to the completion of the glazing, and his vigilance to the cleansing of the furnace.

\p
\v 22 At his word, the waters stood still, as if piled together. And at the words of his mouth, the waters were contained, as if in basins of water.

\v 13 For a moth goes forth from garments, and iniquity over a man goes forth from a woman.\f + \fr 42:13 \ft Iniquity pertaining to men, i.e. sins committed because of her attraction to a man, proceeds from a woman. Again, this advice pertains to a young unmarried daughter and is in the context of the previous verse about avoiding sins related to attraction of a young unmarried daughter to men.\f*
\p
\v 14 Yet iniquity over a man is better for her than if a married woman, seeking to benefit her, instead leads her into confusion and disgrace.\f + \fr 42:14 \ft Yet the iniquity of a man [sins of women pertaining to men] is better than a woman [an older married woman] seeking to benefit [the younger unmarried woman] and yet confusing her to her disgrace.\f*\f + \fr 42:14 \ft The sense of verse 14 is that even though the problems a daughter might encounter, which are warned against in verse 13, are harmful, there is a worse situation, that of married women influencing your daughter, leading her into confusion and disgrace. This passage is not saying that men’s sins are better than women’s sins. Rather, it is advice as to how to advise and govern a young unmarried daughter. If she hangs around older women, they might think to ‘help’ her by giving her advice about men which is not fitting to someone who is young and unmarried, so instead of benefiting her, they would lead her into confusion and disgrace. In other words, hanging around older married women might corrupt your virgin unmarried daughter, since they might talk about men in a licentious manner.\f*

\v 18 He has examined the abyss and the hearts of men. And he has considered their astuteness.

\v 22 and nothing can be taken away. And he has no need of any counselor.
\p
\v 23 O how desirable are all his works! And all that we consider is but a spark.
\p
\v 24 All these works exist, and they remain in the present age, and they all obey him in every purpose.
\p

\p
\v 21 He will pour out frost like salt upon the earth. And when it freezes, it will become like the tops of thistles.

\v 24 Relief for all is in the hurried arrival of a cloud.

\v 12 He provided him with a holy robe of gold and hyacinth and purple, a woven work for a wise man of judgment and truth,
\p
\v 13 a work of twisted scarlet, the work of an artist, with precious stones, cut and set in gold, and engraved by the work of a jeweler, as a memorial according to the number of the tribes of Israel.

\p
\v 19 An eternal covenant was made, with him and with his offspring, like the days of heaven, to execute the office of the priesthood, and to give praise and to glorify his people, in his name.
\p
\v 20 He chose him from among all living men to offer to God sacrifice, incense, and a pleasing fragrance, as a memorial of appeasement on behalf of his people.

\p
\v 8 He anointed kings unto repentance, and he chose the prophets who would follow after him.\f + \fr 48:8 \ft The verb here is in the second person singular because the subject is represented by the pronoun ‘qui’ (who).

\v 9 He was received into a whirlwind of fire, into a swift chariot with fiery horses.

\v 15 And may Nehemiah be remembered for a long time. He raised up for us the walls that had been torn down. And he made firm the gates and the bars. He raised up our houses.
\p
\v 16 No one has been born upon the earth like Enoch. And he was also taken up from the earth.
\p
\v 17 And there was no one like Joseph, who was a man born to be foremost among his brothers, the firmament of his clan, a guide to his brethren, the mainstay of his people.
\p
\v 18 And his bones were visited, and after death, they prophesied.
\p
\v 19 Shem and Seth obtained glory among men. And above every soul, at the very beginning, was Adam.
\c 50
\cl Sirach 50
\p
\v 1 Simon, the high priest, son of Onias: in his life, he propped up the house, and in his days, he strengthened the temple.
\p
\v 2 Even the height of the temple was established by him: the double building and the high walls of the temple.
\p
\v 3 In his days, waters flowed out from the wells, and these were full beyond measure, like the sea.
\p
\v 4 He cared for his nation, and he freed it from perdition.
\p
\v 5 He prevailed, so as to enlarge the city. And he obtained glory by his behavior among the people. And he enlarged the entrance of the house and of the atrium.
\p
\v 6 He shined in his days like the morning star through the midst of a cloud, and like the full moon.
\p
\v 7 And he shined forth in the temple of God in this manner: like the sun when it shines brightly,
\p
\v 8 and like a rainbow shining amid clouds of glory, and like flowering roses in the days of spring, and like lilies along the water’s edge, and like sweet smelling frankincense in the days of summer,
\p
\v 9 like a fire shining brightly, and like frankincense burning within a fire,
\p
\v 10 like a vessel of solid gold, adorned with every precious stone,
\p
\v 11 like an olive tree producing buds, and like a cypress tree lifting itself on high, when he received the robe of glory and was vested with the consummation of virtue.
\p
\v 12 He gave glory to the vestment of sanctity, when he ascended to the holy altar.
\p
\v 13 Then, when he received the portions from the hands of the priests, he himself stood next to the altar. And around him was the crown of his brethren, like a cedar planted on a mountain of Lebanon.
\p
\v 14 And they stood around him like palm branches, and all were sons of Aaron in their glory.
\p
\v 15 Then the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, in the sight of the entire synagogue of Israel. And completing his service at the altar, so as to magnify the offering to the Most High King,
\p
\v 16 he extended his hand to make a libation, and he offered from the blood of the grape.
\p
\v 17 At the base of the altar, he poured out a divine fragrance to the Most High Prince.
\p
\v 18 Then the sons of Aaron shouted; they sounded finely-made trumpets, and they made a great noise, as a memorial in the sight of God.
\p
\v 19 Then all the people at once hurried forward, and they fell to the ground on their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to offer prayers to Almighty God Most High.
\p
\v 20 And the singers of Psalms raised their voices, and a full sweet sound increased in the great house.
\p
\v 21 And the people petitioned the Most High Lord in prayer, even until the honor of the Lord was completed, and they finished offering their gifts.
\p
\v 22 Then, descending, he extended his hands over the entire congregation of the sons of Israel, to give glory to God from his lips, and to glory in his name.
\p
\v 23 And he repeated his prayer, wanting to reveal the virtue of God.
\p
\v 24 And now, pray to the God of all, who has accomplished great things over all the earth, who has increased our days from our mother’s womb, and who has acted toward us in accord with his mercy.
\p
\v 25 May he give us joyfulness in heart, and may there be peace in our days, in Israel for unending days,
\p
\v 26 so that Israel may trust the mercy of God to be with us, in order to free us in his days.
\p
\v 27 Two nations my soul hates, and a third, which I hate, is not a nation:
\p
\v 28 those who sit upon mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people who live at Shechem.
\p
\v 29 Jesus, the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, who renewed wisdom from his heart, wrote the doctrine of wisdom and discipline in this book.
\p
\v 30 Blessed is he who lives by these good things. Whoever places these things in his heart will be ever wise.
\p
\v 31 For if he does these things, he will prevail in all things. For the light of God is upon his footsteps.
\c 51
\cl Sirach 51
\p
\v 1 The prayer of Jesus, the son of Sirach: I will confess to you, O Lord and King, and I will give praise to you, O God my Savior.
\p
\v 2 I will acknowledge your name. For you have been my Helper and Protector.
\p
\v 3 And you have freed my body from perdition, from the snare of the iniquitous tongue, and from the lips of those who forge lies. And you have been my Helper in the sight of those who stood nearby.
\p
\v 4 And you have freed me according to the multitude of the mercy of your name: from those who roared and prepared to devour,
\p
\v 5 from the hands of those who sought my life, and from the gates of tribulation that surrounded me,
\p
\v 6 from the oppression of the flames that surrounded me, and so I was not burned in the midst of the fire,
\p
\v 7 from the depths of the bowels of hell, and from the defiled tongue, and from lying words, from an iniquitous king, and from an unjust tongue.
\p
\v 8 My soul shall praise the Lord, even unto death.
\p
\v 9 For my life was drawing near to hell below.
\p
\v 10 And they surrounded me on every side. And there was no one who would help me. I looked around for the assistance of men, and there was none.
\p
\v 11 Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord, and your works, which are from the very beginning.
\p
\v 12 For you rescue those who persevere for you, O Lord, and you free them from the hands of the Gentiles.\f + \fr 51:12 \ft In the Christian interpretation of Scripture, the Gentiles would refer to non-believers (heathens), not to non-Jews.\f*
\p
\v 13 You exalted my habitation upon the earth, and I made supplication that death would pass away.
\p
\v 14 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, so that he would not abandon me in the day of my tribulation, nor in the time of arrogance without assistance.
\p
\v 15 I will praise your name unceasingly, and I will praise it with thanksgiving, for my prayer was heeded.
\p
\v 16 And you freed me from perdition, and you rescued me from the time of iniquity.
\p
\v 17 Because of this, I will give thanks and praise to you, and I will bless the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 18 When I was still young, before I wandered astray, I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.
\p
\v 19 I asked for her before the temple, and even to the very end, I will inquire after her. And she flourished like a newly-ripened grape.
\p
\v 20 My heart rejoiced in her. My feet walked in the right path. From my youth, I pursued her.
\p
\v 21 I bent my ear a little and accepted her.
\p
\v 22 I found much wisdom within myself, and I benefited greatly by her.
\p
\v 23 I will give glory to him who gives wisdom to me.
\p
\v 24 For I have decided that I should act according to wisdom. I have been zealous for what is good, and so I will not be confounded.
\p
\v 25 My soul has struggled for wisdom, and in doing so, I have been confirmed.
\p
\v 26 I extended my hands on high, and I mourned my ignorance of her.
\p
\v 27 I directed my soul toward her, and I found her within knowledge.
\p
\v 28 From the beginning, I held my heart to wisdom. Because of this, I will not be forsaken.
\p
\v 29 My stomach was stirred up while seeking her. Because of her, I will hold a good possession.
\p
\v 30 The Lord has given me a tongue as my reward, and I will praise him with it.
\p
\v 31 Draw near to me, you who are untaught, and gather yourselves into the house of discipline.
\p
\v 32 Why are you reluctant? And what do you have to say about these things? Your souls are exceedingly thirsty!
\p
\v 33 I have opened my mouth, and I have spoken. Buy wisdom for yourselves without silver,
\p
\v 34 and subject your neck to her yoke, and let your soul accept her discipline. For she is close enough to be found.
\p
\v 35 See with your own eyes how I have labored only a little, and have found much rest for myself.
\p
\v 36 Take up discipline, as if it were a great sum of money, and possess an abundance of gold in her.
\p
\v 37 Let your soul rejoice in his mercy. For you will not be confounded by his praise.
\p
\v 38 Accomplish your work before the time. And he will give you your reward in his time.
