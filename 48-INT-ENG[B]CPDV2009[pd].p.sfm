\imt1 The Writing of the New Testament
\imi “... and he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, so that every nation was able to hear and to read, in various languages and letters, that husbands are to be the greater rulers in their own houses, and that this should be published to every people.” \rq (Esther 3:22)\rq*
\b
\is1 Languages
\im Most modern scholars believe that the New Testament was written almost entirely in Greek. There are a few exact-language quotes from Christ in the Gospels, such as Mk 5:41 and Mk 15:34, which are preserved in the original Aramaic. Christ most often used Aramaic during His teaching Ministry. Some modern scholars think that Matthew may have originally been written in Aramaic. But, as for the rest of the New Testament, most scholars think it was written almost entirely in Greek.
\ip On the contrary, a strong argument can be made that the New Testament was written using several different languages: Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and Aramaic. The authors of the books of the New Testament wrote in different regions of the world, for different groups of Christians, who spoke and read and wrote in different languages. I believe that most of the New Testament was originally written in languages other than Greek.
\ip For example, Saint Jerome and Bishop Eusebius each asserted that Matthew's Gospel was originally written in the Hebrew language and that copies of Matthew in Hebrew were still in existence during their lifetimes. Matthew wrote for the Christians of Judea, who were formerly Hebraic Jews. Mark wrote his Gospel in Latin, because he was writing for the Christians of Rome, whose first language was Latin. Luke certainly did write in Greek, but only because he was writing to Theophilus, a political leader in Greece who was of Greek descent, and to those Christians around Theophilus who had influenced him towards conversion. John wrote for the diverse groups of Christians in Asia (western Turkey), but he also wrote knowing that the other Gospels were in wide circulation. John wrote in Aramaic.
\ip Saint Paul wrote letters to several different churches and several different individuals in various countries and cities. Peter wrote his first letter to the Christians who were formerly Jews of the Dispersion (living in diverse places away from Judea). These were Hebraic Christians, who used Hebrew as their written language. Peter wrote his second letter to the Christians who were neither Hebrews nor Jews (2 Pet 1:1).
\ip Each author wrote more or less independently of the others. Each did not realize that he was writing a part of one infallible Sacred Scripture, which would be called the New Testament. Each author probably was familiar with, and able to use, more than one language. The common languages of that time and place were Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and Aramaic.
\ip A writer of any book of the New Testament would have to chose a language which would be understood by his audience and which he himself could speak and write fluently. These two criteria were indispensable. What author would write any work in a language which his intended audience could not understand? What author could write a work in a language in which he himself was not fluent?
\ip Now, what are the odds that each and every author, writing independently, would happen to write in the same language and always in Greek? Was every author of the New Testament fluent in reading and writing Greek? Did every Christian in every church understand Greek well? If not, then what reason would the authors have for writing in Greek only? Why would Paul, when writing to different cities, in different areas of the world, to people who spoke different languages, always write in Greek? Would he not rather write in whatever language was common to those he was addressing? Why would Mark, writing for the Christians of Rome, write in Greek? Would he not rather write to them in their own first language, Latin, a language he learned during his many years among them? Why would Matthew, writing for Christians who were of Hebraic descent and who were converts from Judaism, write in Greek? Would he not rather address them in their own language?
\ip This widespread and completely ridiculous tenet of modern Biblical scholars, that the New Testament was written almost entirely in Greek, does not fit the information we have about the languages and cultures of that time period. On the contrary, the New Testament, including the Gospels and the Epistles, was written in various languages-Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and Aramaic-depending on the particular group of Christians being addressed. Each of the Gospels was written in a different language because each Gospel addresses a different group, each was written in a different time period, and each was written in a different region of the world. This principle also applies to a great extent with the Epistles. Paul wrote his letters in different languages, depending on the language of the Christians he was addressing. He needed help writing in certain languages. He received that help from Tertius, Sosthenes, Timothy, Silvanus, and perhaps others. This conclusion is much more reasonable than the inexplicable claim that every author wrote in Greek, regardless of whether or not the intended audience even knew the Greek language, regardless of whether or not the author was proficient in Greek. The exaltation of the Greek language above the other languages of Scripture is a common error in Biblical studies.
\ip No one in their right mind would write to a group of first century Hebraic Jews, or to those among the first Christians who were formerly Hebraic Jews, in the Greek language. Hebrew-speaking Jews often did not get along with Greek-speaking Jews. The friction between the two groups continued even after many from each group converted to Christianity. At one point in time, the Hebraic Christians and the Hellenist Christians had such a serious disagreement with one another that the dispute had to be settled by the Twelve Apostles; they called together the body of the disciples and appointed the first Deacons (Acts 6:1-6). Now suppose that a group of Hebraic Jews, or a group of Christians who were formerly Hebraic Jews, received a letter on a religious topic, in Greek rather than in Hebrew. They would be upset and offended, if they were addressed in the Greek language in a letter on any religious topic.
\ip That is why, when Paul spoke to a crowd in Jerusalem (Acts 22:2ff), he spoke to them in their own language, Hebrew. Paul knew some Greek (Acts 21:37-38) and he knew Aramaic, but he spoke to the crowd of Jews in Hebrew because he was addressing them on a religious topic, trying to convince them that he was a faithful Jew. Likewise, when Matthew wrote his Gospel for the Christians of Judea, who were mostly of Hebraic descent and former Jews, he wrote in Hebrew. The letter to the Hebrews was written for Jews and Christians who were descended from Abraham, so it must have been written in Hebrew. Why would the author of the Letter to the Hebrews write in Greek? He clearly was not writing to the Greek-speaking non-Hebraic Jews. He was writing to those who were descendents of Abraham: “God spoke of old to our fathers” (Heb 1:1), “he is concerned but with the descendents of Abraham” (Heb 2:16), and likewise in other verses. He knew that the Hebraic Jews would be offended if he wrote to them in Greek. The Letter to the Hebrews could only have been written in Hebrew. Greek would have been the last possible choice of language for writing to Hebraic Jews or to Christians who were formerly Hebraic Jews.
\ip The original books of the New Testament, in their various languages, have been lost. We do not have the original manuscripts from any of the books of the Bible. For the New Testament, the oldest extant copies of each book are in Greek (with occasional words or phrases in Aramaic). But this fact does not warrant the conclusion that each book was originally written in Greek. There is much evidence to the contrary.
\is1 Authors
\im The New Testament has 10 major authors: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Hebrews-author, James the Less, Peter, John the elder, Jude (brother of James). This count is based on the idea that the Letter to the Hebrews was not written by Paul and that the Letters from John are not from John the Gospel writer, but from John the elder. It also is based on the idea that the books of the New Testament were basically written by the traditional authors, i.e. that Matthew wrote the Gospel of Matthew, that John wrote Revelation, etc.
\ip The New Testament has at least 6 minor authors: Mark-conclusion, John-disciple(s), Tertius (Romans), Sosthenes (1 Cor), Timothy (2 Cor, Phil, Col, 1 Thess, 2 Thess, Phil), Silvanus (1 Thess, 2 Thess, 1 Peter?). There certainly may have been more than 6 minor authors. For example, Paul may have had persons helping him write and translate his letters, other than those whose names are actually mentioned. The additions to the Gospel of John may have been the work of a group of John's disciples, “we know that his testimony is true,” or of one person (representing a group), “I suppose that the world itself….” (John 21: 24, 25). Some ancient copies of Mark's Gospel lack the last set of verses (Mk 16:9-20). Mark probably did not write those verses; they were added at a later date, (but not much later,) by another author who was, nevertheless, also writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
\ip Interestingly, there were no women authors of Sacred Scripture. During Old Testament times, Jewish priests and scribes were exclusively men. Women did not have the role of priest or scribe in ancient Israel. There are some exemplary women mentioned in the Old Testament, including Judith, Ruth, and Esther, but these books are not first person accounts; they do not claim to have been written by these women. Each woman is referred to in the third person. Also, none of the books of the prophets are about women prophets. Men were given the role of prophet in Old Testament times, not women.
\ip In the New Testament, the four Gospels were written by men, as were the other books of the New Testament. The specific authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews is unclear. In the past, it was often claimed to be the work of St. Paul, yet this Letter does not use Paul's name as do his other letters. Although Hebrews does not appear to have been written by Paul, it was clearly written by a man. There are repeated references, such as “holy brethren” (Heb 3:1), and “Take care, brethren” (Heb 3:12), and “Let brotherly love continue” (Heb 13:1), and similar references. Such repeated male leadership references are inconsistent with the idea of a woman as a leader and author of this text. The author of Hebrews is clearly a leader in the Christian community. In addition to giving instruction in the letter, the author speaks with some authority, and says that the author may arrive with Timothy, another leader in the early Church. Furthermore, in the discourse on fathers and sons, the author then includes himself in the role of son. First, he says God disciplines as a father disciplines his sons (Heb 12:7); then he says “we have had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them” (Heb 12:9). This places the author in the role previously described as a relationship between a father and his sons. Thus, the text of Hebrews is consistent with a male author, not a female author. None of the books of the Old or New Testament were written by women. The Bible was written by men, under the inspiration of God. God has given men and women different roles in the Church, the family, and society.
\ip All of Sacred Scripture is the inspired writing of the Holy Spirit. Regardless of which persons or how many persons wrote any book of the Bible, God remains the One True Author of all. John wrote his Gospel, but some other persons completed it, all under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Paul wrote his letters, but with help from Tertius, Sosthenes, Timothy, Silvanus, and perhaps others. Yet each book of the Bible is entirely the work of the One God, Who is Author of all.

\mte9 NT Introduction
\periph The Gospels - Languages
\imt1 The Writing of the Gospels - Which Languages Did Jesus Use? 
\h0 Introduction
\h1 The Gospels 
\is1 Aramaic
\im Christ taught and spoke mainly in Aramaic. The Gospels record some of Christ's words in the original Aramaic. When He healed a little girl, He said in Aramaic, “Talitha cumi,” (Mk 5:41) which means, 'Little girl, get up.' When He healed a deaf man, who spoke poorly because he was deaf, He said, “Ephphatha,” which is Aramaic for, “Be opened.” (Mk 7:34). On the Cross, when Christ cried out to His Father in Heaven, He spoke in the language of His daily life on earth, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Mk 15:34). Christ mainly spoke Aramaic, as was the custom for persons living in Israel and other areas around the Mediterranean during that time period.
\is1 Hebrew
\im Christ also spoke and taught, occasionally, in Hebrew. He often read the Scriptures and taught in the synagogues on the Sabbath. “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and he went to the synagogue, as his custom was, on the sabbath day. And he stood up to read; and there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written…” (Lk 4:16-17). When Jesus read from the Scriptures, He read in Hebrew. The Hebraic Jews of Israel generally knew both Aramaic (their daily language) and Hebrew (the language of their faith). Hebrew was their preferred written language since it was the language of their Scriptures. After reading the Scriptures, Jesus could have taught in either Aramaic or Hebrew and been understood. However, He probably taught in the synagogue in Hebrew.
\ip When Paul had to defend himself, and his faithfulness as a Jew, to the Jews of Jerusalem, he spoke in Hebrew. “ 'Brethren and fathers, hear the defense which I now make before you.' And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet.” (Acts 22:1-2). The Jews listened more intently when Paul spoke in Hebrew, because it was their faith language, the language associated with their Scriptures. When Christ taught in the synagogues, He may well have used Hebrew for much the same reason.
\ip Christ may also have used Hebrew when debating with the Pharisees and Sadducees. They would have preferred to use Hebrew when arguing with Christ for several reasons. Hebrew was the language of their faith. They were literate and well-educated, in contrast to the illiterate or minimally-literate general population. They could therefore show off their education to the crowd listening to the debate by speaking Hebrew. Also, they considered Christ to be uneducated because He was not one of them and did not study and learn from them. They could test Christ by speaking to Him in Hebrew, thinking that they would be able to speak that language more eloquently than He would (which turned out not to be the case). Christ would have used Hebrew to reply to their arguments in Hebrew, and He would have done so with simple and profound eloquence.
\ip Matthew wrote in Hebrew; Mark wrote in Latin; Luke wrote in Greek. Christ taught, at least some of the time, in Hebrew. Matthew had to translate much, but not all of Christ's words from Aramaic into Hebrew. Some of Christ's words in Matthew's Gospel were probably written just as Christ spoke them, in Hebrew. Likely verses in Matthew, which Christ originally spoke in Hebrew, include the following. Wherever Christ quotes Scripture, there is a likelihood that He quoted it in the Hebrew language. For example, Christ said, “Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' ” (Mt 9:13; Hos 6:6). Christ was speaking to some Pharisees, who knew Hebrew well, and he was speaking somewhat privately, i.e. not teaching a large crowd as in Matthew 5. When Christ spoke privately to Saul, who was at the time a Pharisee, He spoke in Hebrew (Acts 26:14). A nice example of Christ quoting the Hebrew Scripture is found in Matthew 21:42. Jesus there uses the Hebrew expression, “head of the corner,” sometimes translated to English as “cornerstone.”
\ip Christ may also have integrated some Hebrew when He was teaching or speaking in Aramaic. For example, Christ said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” (Mt 11:15). In addition to quoting from Scripture, Christ also used some expressions that are similar to, or that play off of, Scripture passages. The Old Testament has many verses that use some version of an expression which refers to hearing God or being heard by God. Much of what Christ says has similarities to Old Testament expressions. When quoting the Old Testament, Christ may have switched from Aramaic to Hebrew, and when using expressions based on Scripture, He may also have used Hebrew. Putting an expression in Hebrew, in the midst of a talk to Jews using Aramaic, would have the effect of coining a phrase or of giving particular emphasis to that expression.
\is2 Other Persons Who Spoke Hebrew
\im Some of the other persons quoted by Matthew in Hebrew may also have originally spoken in Hebrew. For example, two blind men shouted, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.” This exclamation was meant to indicate that Christ is the Messiah; it was a deeply religious expression with roots in the Hebrew Scriptures. Thus, the expression could well have been in Hebrew. When Paul wanted to be heard by the Jews of Jerusalem, he spoke in Hebrew (Acts 22).
\ip When the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons,” (Mt 9:34), they may have been speaking in Hebrew, because they were well schooled in Hebrew and were speaking of a religious matter as (supposed) religious experts. When the Sadducees and the Pharisees argued with Christ, they may have used Hebrew, partly because it was a religious argument based on the Scriptures, but partly also to test him. They likely considered Christ to be uneducated, since He was not a student or teacher among the religious parties who held sway at that time (the Pharisees and Sadducees). So, they may have spoken in Hebrew for at least some of their debates. A good example of this is seen in Matthew 22:15-46. Likewise, then the chief priests and the council brought false testimony against Jesus, and judged Him guilty of blasphemy, they perhaps held this religious proceeding in Hebrew (Mt 26).
\is1 Latin and Greek
\im Did Christ ever use Latin or Greek? The society of first century Palestine was a multi-lingual society. Aramaic was widely used. The Hebraic Jews generally knew Hebrew as well as Aramaic. The Roman influence in the region brought the Latin language into usage. Jews who were not of Hebraic descent, who were converts or were children of converts, generally used Greek as their written language instead of Hebrew. Many important scholarly works were written in Greek; Greek scholarship competed with Latin scholarship for the attention of educated readers. Thus, the title on the Cross was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin (John 19:20). Though Aramaic was the most common spoken language, those who were literate used Hebrew or Latin or Greek (or more than one of these) as their written language. Christ lived in a society where Latin and Greek were used, so He had some familiarity with those languages.
\ip The Herodians were a group of Jewish priests who supported the rule of the Romans and the Herod family. As Jews and educated priests, they would have known Aramaic and Hebrew. But they used religious ideas to support the rule of the Romans and the Herods. The Herodians must therefore have known Latin, for this was the language associated with their belief system. Latin was the language of the Romans. When the Herodians disputed with Christ, they likely used Latin. They did so to display their adherence to Roman rule and because they thought Christ to be much less educated than themselves. “And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to entrap him in his talk.” (Mk 12:13). So, they used Latin to see if they could trap Christ with words. Their eloquence in Latin would surely exceed His-but such was not the case. Christ may well have replied to them in Latin, for “When they heard it, they marveled….” (Mt 22:22). Unfortunately for them, they marveled, not at the truth and insight of Christ's words, but in large part because Christ gave a Roman-like answer, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” (Mt 22:21). The language and the phrasing were both Latin, and the way of thinking was Roman.
\ip In another context, when Christ and Pilate spoke privately, they may have used Latin. And Pilate may have spoken Latin, when he said: “What I have written, I have written.” (Jn 19:22). The phrase has a Latin feel to it, rather like the famous saying: “I came, I saw, I conquered.” And perhaps the centurion spoke in Latin when he said, “Truly this was the Son of God!” (Mt 27:54). In any case, Latin was used by the Romans in first century A.D. Palestine, so Christ probably encountered one occasion or another where He used Latin.
\ip Christ may also had occasion to speak Greek. During the time of Christ's Ministry, there were many Jews who were not of Hebraic descent. These were converts to Judaism or descendents of converts; they used Greek as their main written language. Already by the time of Christ, they had translated the Jewish Scriptures into Greek in a version called the Septuagint. They used Greek in their synagogues and the members often spoke Greek, though not always as their main spoken language; in many areas Aramaic was the dominant spoken language. There were many Greek-speaking synagogues outside of Israel, but probably also some number of Greek synagogues within Israel during that time period. Jesus customarily went to the synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath (Lk 4:16). He traveled to many different areas. His Ministry was aimed firstly at the Jews. And, though Hebraic Jews often shunned Greek-speaking Jews (who were not of descendents of Abraham; cf. Acts 21:28), Jesus even agreed to stay in a Samaritan town (Jn 4:40). The Samaritans practiced an altered version of the Jewish faith; they were not pagans. It is entirely possible, then, that Jesus could have attended one Greek-speaking synagogue or another, where the Scriptures were read from the Septuagint in Greek and where Greek was a common spoken language.
\ip Incidentally, when Paul says, “For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all…. (Rom 10:12),” he is not referring to Jews and non-Jews, nor, by way of analogy, to Christians and non-Christians. The term “Greek,” in this context, refers to Greek-speaking Jews. Paul is saying that there is no distinction between Christians who were formerly Hebraic Jews and Christians who were formerly Greek-speaking Jews, and, by analogy, that there should be no such distinctions within the Christian faith. The Hebraic Jews kept themselves separate from the Greek-speaking Jews and had a low regard for them (Acts 21:28). This conflict between the two groups continued even after some persons from each group became Christians (Acts 6:1ff).
\is1 The Virgin Mary and Language
\im Mary used Aramaic as her daily spoken language because this was the daily language of the people of Israel during that time period. Mary was one of the virgins in God's service at the Temple of Jerusalem from about three to fourteen years of age (according to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich). There she and the other girls were taught to read and write Hebrew, since this was necessary to the proper understanding of the Jewish Scriptures. Devout Hebraic Jews of that time period generally knew Hebrew as well as Aramaic. For example, when Saint Paul gave a defense of himself to the Jews at Jerusalem, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language and so they listened more intently (Acts 22). The Virgin Mary could read and write Hebrew and could speak both Hebrew and Aramaic.
\ip When the angel Gabriel spoke to Mary at the Annunciation, he most likely spoke to her in Hebrew. This was the language of the Jewish faith. The Scriptures were read in Hebrew (in Hebraic synagogues) and the sermons were most likely in Hebrew as well. When Jesus spoke to Saul (St. Paul) on the road to Damascus, He spoke to Saul in Hebrew (Acts 26). It is likely that Hebrew was often used for conversations about the Jewish faith. When Mary replied to the angel, she replied in Hebrew.
\ip When Mary spoke her Magnificat, she most likely spoke in Hebrew. The Magnificat contains numerous allusions to Jewish Scripture, which Mary knew well in the Hebrew language. Her canticle of praise to God was most likely spoken in Hebrew because it was an expression of religious devotion from a devout Jew. For much the same reasons, when Zechariah, a Jewish priest, spoke a similar poetic expression of praise for God (Lk 1:67-79), he also used the Hebrew language. The same can be said of Zechariah's conversation in the Temple with the angel Gabriel (Lk 1:8-20), and of the angel's words to the shepherds concerning the Birth of Christ (Lk 2:8-20), and of Simeon's words during the Jewish ceremony required by Leviticus 12 (Lk 2:22-35). The Hebrew language was the preferred language for such devout conversations and expressions of religious devotion.

\periph Matthew Introduction
The Writing of the Gospels - Matthew 

“As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he rose and followed him.” (Mt 9:9).

Matthew the evangelist was a tax collector (or “publican”) before his call to follow Jesus. As a tax collector, Matthew could read and write competently. Most people at that time in history were illiterate or could read and write only a little.

Matthew was also called Levi (Mk 2:14), a Jewish name. Matthew was both a tax collector for the Romans and a Jew. For this reason, he was something of an outcast in devout Jewish society. The scribes and Pharisees treated Jewish tax collectors unkindly and would not even eat a meal with them (Mk 2:16).

Which Language?

Matthew was a Jewish tax collector. As a literate Jew, he must have been able to read and write Hebrew. Eusebius and Jerome attest to this fact. As a tax collector for the Romans, he must also have been able to read and write Latin. He chose to write the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew because he was writing for the Christians of Judea. Most of the first Christians of Judea were originally Jewish. Many were illiterate, but those who did learn to read and write most often learned Hebrew. It is unlikely that Matthew could read and write Greek.

It was not Matthew's idea to write the Gospel. He was prevailed upon by the Hebraic Christians of Judea to write the Gospel in their language, Hebrew, before he left to preach in distant lands. According to Eusebius:
“Matthew had begun by preaching to Hebrews; and when he made up his mind to go to others too, he committed his own gospel to writing in his native tongue, so that for those with whom he was no longer present the gap left by his departure was filled by what he wrote.” (Eusebius, History of the Church, 3.24.6-7).
Eusebius was Bishop of Caesarea, a student of Pamphilus, and an early Church historian. He lived from approximately A.D. 260 to 340. Saint Jerome was born roughly about the same time that Eusebius died, about A.D. 340 or so. Jerome also states that the Gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew.
“Matthew, also called Levi, apostle and aforetimes publican, composed a gospel of Christ at first published in Judea in Hebrew for the sake of those of the circumcision who believed, but this was afterwards translated into Greek though by what author is uncertain. The Hebrew itself has been preserved until the present day in the library at Caesarea which Pamphilus so diligently gathered. I have also had the opportunity of having the volume described to me by the Nazarenes of Beroea, a city of Syria, who use it. In this it is to be noted that wherever the Evangelist, whether on his own account or in the person of our Lord the Saviour quotes the testimony of the Old Testament he does not follow the authority of the translators of the Septuagint but the Hebrew. Wherefore these two forms exist 'Out of Egypt have I called my son,' and 'for he shall be called a Nazarene.' ” (Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, chapter 3).
Saint Jerome states that the Hebrew version of Matthew was still in existence during his lifetime in Pamphilus' library at Caesarea. Eusebius was Bishop of Caesarea (about a generation or two before Jerome). Eusebius studied under Pamphilus at Caesarea and he also spoke of Matthew's Gospel in the original Hebrew. Jerome also knew that the Hebrew version of Matthew's Gospel was in use during his lifetime by a certain group of Christians in Syria.

When St. Jerome refers to the Hebrew language, he could not possibly mean Aramaic. The Jews did use Aramaic as an everyday language. However, Hebrew was their preferred written language because the Torah was written in Hebrew. Also, later in that same paragraph, Jerome tells us that Matthew did not follow the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), but rather the Hebrew version of the Old Testament. As evidence of this, he cites Mt 2:15 and 2:23, verses where Matthew quotes Hosea 11:1 and Judges 13:7, books of the Old Testament written in Hebrew, not Aramaic. Therefore, when Jerome says Hebrew, he does not mean Aramaic.

Jerome also said that the Book of Sirach was originally written in Hebrew, and that copies of that book in Hebrew were extant during his lifetime. Over the centuries, many scholars doubted Saint Jerome's claim, with some saying that Jerome actually meant Aramaic, (which was formerly the main spoken language of the Jews). After several discoveries of fragments and portions of the Book of Sirach in the original Hebrew, scholars had to admit that when Jerome said it was written in Hebrew, he did not mean Aramaic. (Catholic Encyclopedia online, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05263a.htm)

And Saint Jerome gives us further evidence that Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Hebrew. He tells us that copies of the Hebrew version were to be found in Alexandria:
“Pantaenus …was sent to India by Demetrius bishop of Alexandria, where he found that Bartholomew, one of the twelve apostles, had preached the advent of the Lord Jesus according to the gospel of Matthew, and on his return to Alexandria he brought this with him written in Hebrew characters.” (Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, chapter 36).
The name Pantaenus refers to Saint Pantaenus, who lived about 100 years before Eusebius. The name “India,” during the time of Pantaenus, was used to refer to various areas east of the Red Sea, including Arabia, Persia, and Parthia, but not present-day India.

When Was It Written?

After Christ's Crucifixion, Resurrection, and scension, Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot as the twelfth Apostle. After Pentecost, the Twelve Apostles remained in Jerusalem and the surrounding area. They did not yet travel to distant lands to preach the Gospel. At the time of the appointment of the first Deacons, the Twelve Apostles were still together.

“And the twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said, 'It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.' ” (Acts 2-4).

After the martyrdom of Saint Stephen, one of the first Deacons, there was a persecution: “And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.” (Acts 8:1). Notice that even though many disciples were scattered by the persecution in Jerusalem, they still remained in the general area. Jerusalem is found within the area of Judea, and Samaria is just to the north of Judea. But the Apostles were not scattered by this persecution; they remained in Jerusalem.

By the time that St. James the greater was beheaded by Herod Agrippa I (Acts 12:1-3), only Peter and James the Less were left in Jerusalem and the surrounding area. If other the Apostles had been in Jerusalem at that time, Herod would have tried to arrest them, just as he arrested Peter. After his escape from jail, Peter fled to Rome. The Apostle James the Less remained always in Jerusalem, for he was the leader of that community (Acts 12:17); James was the Bishop of Jerusalem.

At some point between the martyrdom of Stephen and the martyrdom of James the greater, the Apostles began to travel to distant lands to preach the Gospel. But they did not leave all at once. They left one or two at a time to preach the Gospel in distant lands. It might have seemed to some of the disciples that eventually all of the Apostles would leave. As one Apostle after another left the area, the Christians of Judea became anxious to have a written record of the Gospel message. Most of the first Christians of Judea were converts from the Jewish faith. Those among them who could read and write were most fluent in Hebrew. The schools they attended were taught by the Jewish priests. They needed someone to write the Gospel in Hebrew. Matthew was the obvious choice. He was, like them, a Jew turned Christian. He could read and write fluently (an essential skill for both tax collectors and Gospel writers).

The Gospel of Matthew, according to Jerome and Eusebius, was written before the other Gospels. Matthew wrote it for the first generation of Christians, who lived in Judea and were mostly (former) Jews. He wrote it before he left for distant lands to preach the Gospel and before Peter left Jerusalem for Rome. Matthew's Gospel was written first, before Mark, Luke, and John.

The Gospel of Matthew was written between three to six years after the Ascension of Christ, during the reign of the emperor Gaius [Caligula]. See the author's book, Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, chapter 11, for a detailed chronology of the early Church, the Gospels, and Paul's missionary journeys.

The Title

What was the Title of Matthew's Gospel? Most authors give their works titles. But it is very unlikely that Matthew named his Gospel, “The Gospel According To Matthew.” Such a title would have been contrary to the humility and wisdom of an Apostle. And most author's do not use their own name in the title of their work.

The Gospel of Matthew begins with these words: “The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.” (Mt 1:1). At first glance, this lengthy set of words does not seem like a title. Authors today generally prefer short titles, sometimes consisting of only one or two words. But in ancient times, as seen for example the books of Flavius Josephus (who lived and wrote in the first century A.D.), titles were often as long as a full sentences (or even a few sentences). Notice also that the first verse is not a sentence; it lacks a verb. The title of Matthew's Gospel is the entire first verse: The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Matthew's gospel is titled this way because it is presented as a confirmation to Hebraic Christians that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah of the Jews, who was to be a descendent of David and of Abraham.

\periph Mark Intro
The Writing of the Gospels - Mark 

“When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.” (Acts 12:12).

“She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings; and so does my son Mark.” 
(1 Peter 5:13).

James' Martyrdom and Peter's Arrest

In Acts of the Apostles, chapter 12, king Herod Agrippa I (grandson of Herod the great) has the Apostle James the Greater beheaded. Herod had just returned from Rome, where Claudius, in his second year as emperor, had given Herod authority over Jerusalem and the surrounding area, Judea. Herod left Rome for Jerusalem by boat as soon as possible. He could not have left sooner than early to mid February, because sailing the Mediterranean was considered too dangerous during the winter. He arrived in Jerusalem just before Passover and discovered that there were conflicts between the Jews and the Christians. Earlier that year, Claudius had given the Jewish faith a protected status within the Roman empire. Herod wanted to please Claudius, so he responded to the conflict between Jews and Christians by having James the Apostle beheaded. 

James the Greater was beheaded just prior to the days of Unleavened Bread. Herod would not have put anyone to death during the Passover, for fear of offending the huge crowds. The Scripture passage: “This was during the days of Unleavened Bread,” (Acts 12:3) refers to Peter's arrest. Peter was not put to death right away because the Passover had now begun. Herod probably intended to kill Peter after the Passover, but he escaped and went to the house of Mary, mother of John Mark.

James was martyred just before Passover and Peter was arrested during Passover. At Passover, the Jews would travel to Jerusalem to worship at the Temple. The earliest Christians did not realize that Christianity would become a separate religion from Judaism. Most of the earliest Christians were Jewish and they continued to go to the synagogue (cf. Acts 2:46). Peter and Paul each traveled about preaching in synagogues about Christ. The earliest Christians still kept the Jewish holy days; for example, the day of Pentecost, referred to in Acts 2:1, was the Jewish feast called Pentecost or the Feast of Weeks. The beheading of James and the arrest of Peter most likely occurred in Jerusalem, because that is where everyone was gathered, including Christians, during the Passover. The house of Mary, mother of John Mark, must have been in Judea, near Jerusalem, because Peter was able to flee there after his arrest and because the community of believers would not have gathered far from Jerusalem during Passover.

How Old Was Mark?

The community of believers was gathered at this house for worship and prayer. The house is called the house of Mary, mother of John Mark. Ordinarily, a house would be called after the head of the household, which is the husband and father. Yet he is not mentioned and the house is called after his wife. Therefore, Mary, the mother of John Mark, was a widow. By the time Luke wrote Acts of the Apostles, John Mark was a well-known disciple of Peter and an apostle in his own right. If John Mark had been an adult, the house would be called the house of John Mark. The house is called the house of Mary, mother of John Mark, because Mark was still a young man, perhaps in his teens or early twenties. He was still seen as the son of Mary, his mother, and not yet as a disciple, apostle, and evangelist.

The Apostle Peter refers to Mark as his son, because John Mark was a disciple who learned the Faith from Peter. It was common practice among the early Christians to refer to someone who learned the Faith from them, and who was of the appropriate age, as “son.” Though Peter was leader of even the Twelve Apostles, and teacher of the Church as a whole, he still did not refer to persons of about his own age as “sons.” Mark the Evangelist must have been about a generation younger than Peter, young enough to be called his son.

Peter fled to Rome to avoid being arrested again and put to death by Herod Agrippa I. Since this was not a persecution by the emperor of Rome, Peter could safely flee to Rome, where a small and growing Christian community already existed. By all accounts, Mark soon ended up at Rome with Peter. He may well have fled there at the same time as Peter. His mother would have been anxious for his safety, because one of the Twelve Apostles had been executed and the leader of the Apostles had been arrested. Her house would have been a potential target of persecution because the community of believers met there for prayer and because Peter fled there after his escape from jail. As a reasonable and devout Christian woman, she would have had to consider her son's safety. She also would have trusted Peter and been happy to have him act as a surrogate father and teacher of the faith to Mark. In any case, Mark did end up at Rome and, with Peter's guidance, he became a devout disciple of Christ.

Peter's arrest and escape occurred during the reign of Claudius, about 8 years after Christ's Crucifixion, which occurred during the reign of Tiberius. Since Mark was in his teens or early twenties at the time of Peter's arrest and escape, Mark was most likely a child during the time of Christ's Ministry-old enough to understand some of what was being taught, but not yet even a teenager. His mother must have been one of Christ's many disciples, since Acts tells us that the community of believers met in her house for prayer. As a child, Mark may have heard and saw Christ, along with his mother, when Christ was teaching and healing. When Mark finally wrote his Gospel, he based it partly on first-hand knowledge from his younger years, partly on what he learn his mother and other members of that early community of believers, and largely on his many years learning from the Apostle Peter.

When Mark was living in Judea, he was too young to have written a Gospel. Even the Christ did not begin His teaching Ministry until He was about thirty. Only after Mark had studied the Faith under Peter's guidance for many years at Rome, was he ready to write the Gospel. Mark could not have written the Gospel of Mark before Matthew wrote the Gospel of Matthew, because Mark was much younger than Matthew. He was not ready to write about Christ until many years had passed.

Which Language?

Which language did Mark use to write the Gospel? Mark and his mother Mary lived in Judea, near Jerusalem. The community of believers, one of the earliest groups of Christians, met in their house for worship and prayer. Most of the first Christians, especially those from Judea, were Jews who became Christians. If Mark was educated in Judea, when he was a child or teenager, he would have been taught by Jewish teachers. Among the Jews, the priests were the teachers. What limited schools they had were led and taught by Jewish priests, who read and wrote Hebrew themselves and who taught mainly Hebrew reading and writing. If Mark learned to read and write as a child or teen in Judea, then he learned Hebrew. 

However, Mark did move to Rome as a young man. He studied and learned there for many years. Rome was the center of Roman culture and learning; and the Roman language was Latin. As someone learning and studying at Rome, Mark must have learned Latin. Most of the books he would study, other than the Hebrew Scriptures, would have been in Latin. Among the Romans, the Latin language was first; the Greek language was second. Most Roman scholars had no knowledge of, nor use for, Hebrew.

When Mark wrote the Gospel, he was writing for the Christians of Rome and so he must have written the Gospel of Mark in Latin. Mark wrote the Gospel in Latin because the Christians of Rome most often used Latin as their written language. For similar reasons, Matthew wrote in Hebrew because he was writing for a group of Christians who most often used Hebrew as their written language.

Saint Mark was most likely of Hebraic descent and raised as a Jew for most of his early years. Even though he wrote the Gospel in Latin, he could probably read and write Hebrew fairly well. Since Matthew's Gospel was written years before Mark wrote his Gospel, Matthew's Gospel was probably in fairly wide circulation and liturgical use by the time that Mark began to write. Mark had access to Matthew's Gospel. This explains the similarities between those two Gospels. Mark understood Hebrew and had access to Matthew's Gospel in the original Hebrew. Some of the minor differences in parallel passages may come from differences between Matthew's Gospel as it is phrased in the original Hebrew and Matthew's Gospel as we have it today (in the earliest surviving Greek manuscripts). Mark's Gospel gives us a look at what Matthew's Gospel was like in its original language, Hebrew, in one of the earliest copies.

Mark Wrote in Latin

The idea that Mark wrote his Gospel in Latin was once a well-known idea. It is even stated in the brief introductory footnote to Mark's Gospel in the Challoner-Douay-Rheims version of the Bible: “Baronius and others say, that the original was written in Latin….” This idea has fallen out of remembrance in modern times, as it is antithetical to many of the ideas of modernist scholars, who do not believe that Mark wrote the Gospel himself, do not believe that it was written within the same generation as Christ, and do not believe that the Scriptures are infallible. Having lost belief in so many more important aspects of the Gospels, it is not surprising that they doubt or ignore the idea that Mark wrote in Latin.

The Codex Bobbiensis is an ancient copy of (part of) the Gospel of Mark in Latin. It contains the abbreviated ending to Mark:
But they reported briefly to Peter and those with him all that they had been told. And after this Jesus himself sent out by means of them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. (http://www.bible-researcher.com/bobbiensis.html)
This ending is probably the original ending written by Mark, who took his newly written Gospel with him when he left Rome to found the Church in Alexandria. The oldest copies of Mark from the Alexandrian tradition omit verses 16:9-20. Mark did not write that particular ending himself. He may have ended his Gospel with verse 16:8, so that the Codex Bobbiensis ending was added by another author.

Codex Bobbiensis is one of the earliest extant versions of Mark's Gospel, dated to the early third century (the 200's) A.D. The fact that it is in Latin lends support to the idea that Mark was originally written in Latin. Also, that Codex is from Africa, where Mark journeyed after writing his Gospel, so one would expect copies of Mark from that part of the world to be more likely to represent the earliest state of this Gospel.

When Did Mark Write?

Saint Jerome wrote that the Gospel of Mark was sometimes ascribed to the Apostle Peter. (Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, chapter 1.) Jerome is not claiming that Peter wrote the Gospel of Mark. In fact, Peter only found out that Mark had written the Gospel after it was completed. Rather, Peter is given some credit for the content of Mark's Gospel because Mark learned much about Christ from Peter.

Saint Jerome tells us how Mark came to write his Gospel:
“Mark the disciple and interpreter of Peter wrote a short gospel at the request of the brethren at Rome embodying what he had heard Peter tell. When Peter had heard this, he approved it and published it to the churches to be read by his authority as Clemens in the sixth book of his Hypotyposes and Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, record.” (Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, chapter 8.)
Eusebius adds that the faithful in Rome had to pester Mark quite a bit to convince him to write the Gospel:
“So brightly shone the light of true religion on the minds of Peter's hearers that, not satisfied with a single hearing or with the oral teaching of the divine message, they resorted to appeals of every kind to induce Mark (whose gospel we have), as he was a follower of Peter, to leave them in writing a summary of the instruction they had received by word of mouth, nor did they let him go till they had persuaded him, and thus became responsible for the writing of what is known as the Gospel according to Mark. It is said that, on learning by divine revelation of the spirit what had happened, the apostle was delighted at their enthusiasm and authorized the reading of the book in the churches.” (Eusebius, The History of the Church, 2.15.1-2)
Notice, in both Jerome and Eusebius, Peter was initially unaware that Mark was writing his Gospel. Eusebius even says that Peter had to be informed by divine revelation. Therefore, Peter was not in Rome at the time that Mark wrote his Gospel. If Peter had been in Rome, he would surely have known of the repeated appeals by the faithful to Mark and would have known how his follower, Mark, had responded. Instead, Peter had to be informed as to what had occurred. Also, Peter must have been away from Rome for some length of time, long enough for the faithful to spend some time trying to convince Mark to write, then also long enough for Mark to write the whole of his Gospel before Peter even knew anything about it. Peter was most likely on a missionary journey to spread the Gospel, while Mark stayed behind and wrote the Gospel. And why would Peter's missionary journey take so long? Peter was probably spending the winter somewhere, because traveling the Mediterranean in winter was dangerous (Acts 27:10-12). It was quite common for the Apostles to spend the winter in one place, preferring to travel in the other seasons (see Acts 28:11; 2 Tim 4:21; 1 Cor 16:5-6; Titus 3:12). 

Eusebius also tells us that the faithful of Rome not only “resorted to appeals of every kind,” but also did not “let him go till they had persuaded him.” (Eusebius, The History of the Church, 2.15.1-2) Where was Mark going that the faithful of Rome should detain him until he agreed to write the Gospel? Clearly Mark intended to go on a long journey, for if it were a short journey, the faithful of Rome would not have been so anxious to have the Gospel in writing. Could this journey have been one of Peter's missionary journeys to those places mentioned in 1 Peter 1:1 (modern-day Turkey)? No, if Mark did not accompany Peter, because the faithful had already persuaded him before Peter departed, then Peter would have known that Mark was writing the Gospel, which was not the case. Furthermore, Peter certainly returned to Rome after journeying to various places to preach Christ. If Mark had journeyed with Peter, he also would have returned, so that the faithful would not have been so anxious to have his teaching in writing.

Where did Mark intend to go after he wrote the Gospel? Mark likely intended to go on a long journey without Peter, a journey from which he might not return. For this reason, the faithful of Rome were anxious to persuade him to write the Gospel. Eusebius wrote that they sought to convince Mark “to leave them in writing a summary of the instruction they had received by word of mouth.” (Eusebius, History of the Church, 2.15.1-2) This phrasing indicates that Mark intended to go somewhere distant and perhaps never return, so that the faithful would no longer have access to Mark's teaching by his spoken words. Since Peter was away on a long journey of his own, and Mark was about to depart also, the faithful of Rome wanted Peter and Mark's teaching in writing. In this way, the Gospel of Mark came to be written.

Mark did make a long journey from which he did not return; he traveled to Egypt to preach the Gospel. “So, taking the gospel which he himself composed, he went to Egypt and first preaching Christ at Alexandria he formed a church so admirable in doctrine and continence of living that he constrained all followers of Christ to his example.” (Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, chapter 8.) Mark completed his Gospel before going to Egypt, and, after preaching there for many years, he suffered a martyr's death. Mark's Gospel was written sometime before Mark traveled to Egypt. Therefore, the faithful of Rome delayed Mark's missionary journey to Egypt by convincing him to first write the Gospel of Mark.

The 15th year after Christ's Ascension (A.D. 34) was the year of the Virgin Mary's Dormition, Resurrection, and Assumption, according to Saint Bridget and Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (See Conte, Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, chap. 10, for the references in this section). According to Blessed Anne Catherine, Peter attended the Dormition of the Virgin Mary and John Mark accompanied him. An ancient source, The History of the Patriarchs of the Coptic Church of Alexandria, states that Mark decided, because of a revelation from God, to make his missionary journey to Alexandria in the 15th year after the Ascension of Christ. But notice that this source does not say that Mark arrived that year, but only that he came to his decision that year. The 15th year after the Ascension of Christ was a likely time for Mark to be inspired to leave Peter and undertake a missionary journey of his own. It was by then the 9th year of Claudius' reign. Mark had been Peter's student and assistant for over seven years, since journeying with Peter from Jerusalem to Rome during the spring of Claudius' 2nd year. He had also followed Paul and Barnabas on some of their missionary journeys. And he had attended the Dormition of the Virgin Mary at Ephesus, along with the remaining Eleven of the Twelve Apostles. The Dormition of the Virgin Mary, as well as her Resurrection and Assumption, inspired Mark to take the next step in following Christ, to go on his own to a distant land and preach the Gospel.

Now it was the faithful of Rome who delayed Mark's missionary journey so that he would first write down the teachings of Christ for them. But the Gospel of Mark must have taken more than a few days or weeks to write. Peter and Mark probably went to Ephesus to attend the death of the Virgin Mary on relatively short notice. They had something of a deadline for beginning this journey. Therefore, this was not the journey that was delayed at the request of the faithful of Rome so that Mark could write his Gospel. Yet at least one ancient source places Mark's decision to go to Egypt in that same year, the 15th since the Ascension.

For the above reasons, I conclude the following. Mark returned to Rome after the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. He was greatly inspired by the Virgin Mary's Dormition, Resurrection, and Assumption, and he may have also received some kind of revelation concerning God's will for him. The result was that he then decided to undertake his mission to preach the Gospel in Egypt. His journey to Egypt became associated with the 15th year after the Ascension because that was the year of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and the year of his decision. But the faithful of Rome, knowing that he might never return from this mission to Egypt, delayed his journey by convincing him to write the Gospel before departing. Mark then took the Gospel, which he himself had recently written, to Egypt and founded the first community of Christians there, at Alexandria. In fact, the phrasing used by both Eusebius and Saint Jerome seems to imply that Mark had written his Gospel not long before journeying to Egypt: “So, taking the gospel which he himself composed, he went to Egypt….” (Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, chapter 8.) Eusebius also mentions the writing of the Gospel of Mark in the same sentence in which he tells us of Mark's journey to Egypt. (Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, Loeb Classical Library, 2.16.1) The Gospel of Mark was written just prior to Mark's journey to Egypt, about the time of the 15th year after Christ's Ascension, during the winter of A.D. 34/35.

When did Mark actually arrive in Egypt? He could not have arrived in the same year as the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (in A.D. 34), which was the 15th year since the Ascension of Christ and the 9th year of Claudius' reign. The Assumption occurred in mid August in Ephesus (Conte, Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, chap. 10). But Mark wrote his Gospel in Rome, prior to leaving for Egypt. Mark must first have traveled back to Rome from Ephesus, a journey that may have taken a month or more, even in good weather. Mark could have arrived back in Rome in September or early October. He reached his decision to undertake a missionary journey to Egypt at the time of the Assumption, or soon after.

There is not enough time between late September and the end of the season for travel on the Mediterranean (Nov. 11, according to Pliny, Natural History, 2.47; see also Acts 27:9ff) to account for Mark writing the Gospel and then undertaking a safe journey to Egypt. First, the faithful of Rome made numerous appeals to Mark to convince him to write, then Mark spent some length of time writing the Gospel, and, when he finally departed, Mark's journey to Egypt from Rome must have taken at least a couple of months. Therefore, although Mark wanted to journey to Egypt soon after returning from the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, the faithful of Rome delayed his journey by convincing him to first write the Gospel. Because he was writing his Gospel, Mark missed the end of the good sailing weather and had to winter in Rome. And Peter was not present in Rome during the writing of the Gospel of Mark because Peter was wintering elsewhere. Thus the delay spoken of by Eusebius was not a matter of days or weeks, but of a whole season. During that time, in late fall and winter of A.D. 34/35, Mark wrote his Gospel. He then departed for Egypt at his next opportunity, sometime in the spring of A.D. 35.

When Mark wrote his Gospel, Peter was not present, nor did Peter even know that the faithful of Rome were pestering Mark to write the Gospel. Peter could have left on a missionary journey soon after returning to Rome from attending the Dormition of the Virgin Mary at Ephesus. But, more likely, Peter did not return to Rome from Ephesus. Instead, he may have visited the churches mentioned in 1 Peter 1:1, which are in the same general area as Ephesus, and decided to winter in that region. Peter's extended absence from Rome (when he did not return from Ephesus with Mark), combined with Mark's intention to soon depart on a long missionary journey of his own, made the faithful of Rome anxious to obtain the Gospel in writing.

In summary, Mark decided to go to Egypt to preach Christ soon after the Dormition of the Virgin Mary. But when the faithful of Rome insisted he write the Gospel before leaving them, he was not able to leave before the sailing season ended and had to pass the whole winter in Rome, writing the Gospel and all the while persevering in his intention to make a missionary journey to Egypt. Since Mark wrote the Gospel without Peter's prior knowledge, Peter must have passed that winter somewhere other than Rome. Then, sometime after the good sailing weather resumed in early February, Mark set out for Egypt. He probably arrived in Egypt in spring of A.D. 35, the 16th year since the Ascension and the same year as the third Council of the Church (Acts 15). The Gospel of Mark was written in the winter of A.D. 34/35, just over 15 years since the Ascension of Christ to Heaven. The Jewish civil calendar year of A.D. 34/35 was also a Sabbatical year (Conte, Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, chap. 16).

The Acts of the Apostles records (Acts 15:36-41) that Mark made a missionary journey with Barnabas from Antioch, sometime after the Council of Acts 15 (A.D. 35). This journey probably occurred in early A.D. 36 (Conte, Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, chap. 11). Mark's journey with Barnabas in A.D. 36 does not rule out Mark's earlier journey to Egypt in early A.D. 35. After spending about a year preaching the Gospel and establishing a new Christian community in Alexandria, Mark certainly could have returned to Antioch. In fact, it is both likely and reasonable that Mark would return to a city with a long-established Christian community after spending some time in a distant mission. Establishing a new church in a distant area is a difficult endeavor, which would benefit from periodic trips to cities with established Christian communities. There, Mark could seek advice and assistance, recruit additional workers in the faith, and perhaps also obtain financial or material support.

In addition, the Gospel of Mark had only recently been written and approved of by Peter. The distribution of this Gospel to Antioch and to other established Christian communities would have resulted in a desire by those communities to hear and meet with the Gospel writer, Mark. Thus, Mark's presence was in demand, giving him another reason to make occasional trips away from his mission in Egypt.

The Title

What was the Title of Mark's Gospel? It is almost certain that Mark did not call his work, “The Gospel According To Mark.” Such a title would be equivalent to saying, “The Gospel According To Me.” Saint Mark does not even mention himself by name within his Gospel, so then he would not put his own name in the title. Mark, and other authors of that time period, would not generally use their own name in the title of a work.

Yet it was the custom among authors of that time period, as is still true today, to give each work a title. For example, in Antiquities of the Jews, by Flavius Josephus, each book (similar to what we today would call a chapter) has a title. Each title is usually fairly lengthy, for example: “What Charge David Gave To His Son Solomon At The Approach Of His Death; And How Many Things He Left Him For The Building Of The Temple” (Antiquities of the Jews, book 7, chapter 15).

The title that Mark gave to his work could possibly have been lost. Sacred Scripture is a work written first and foremost by the Holy Spirit, who sometimes chooses to write a book through more than one human author. One author might write most of a book, but another might put some finishing touches on it (such as removing or adding a passage). Despite this sheer possibility, of all the words written within a book copied and handed down from one person to the next, the title is the least likely portion of the work to become lost.

On the other hand, the title could have remained with the work, even to this day. The Gospel of Mark begins with these words: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.” (Mk 1:1). Among authors today, such a sentence does not seem like a title; authors today prefer short titles, sometimes consisting of only one or two words. But in ancient times, as seen for example the titles of the books of Flavius Josephus (who lived and wrote in the first century A.D.), titles were often sentences or nearly full sentences.

Mark did give his work a title: The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. These words do not refer to the first chapter or first section of Mark's Gospel. They constitute the title of Mark's Gospel. Mark's entire written work (which we call “the Gospel of Mark”) is really only the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Mark is telling us, with the title of this work, that he is presenting only the beginning of the good news brought by Jesus Christ. The Gospel of Christ cannot be contained within the words written by Mark; these words are only the beginning of the gospel. 
\periph Luke Intro
The Writing of the New Testament - Luke and Acts 

“In as much as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been accomplished among us, just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may know the truth concerning the things of which you have been informed.” (Luke 1:1-4).

“In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.” (Acts 1:1-2).

Who Was Theophilus?

The Gospel of Luke is addressed to Theophilus with the expression: “most excellent Theophilus” (Luke 1:3). This phrasing indicates that Theophilus was a Roman official, and not merely a friend or associate of Luke. Both the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles are addressed to this Theophilus. Yet he could not have been very high up in the Roman government because nothing is known about him from other historical evidence. Why then would Luke address two works of such length and importance (both the Gospel and Acts were fairly lengthy works for that time period) to Theophilus?

This Roman official must have expressed an interest in learning about Christ and about the Apostles. He may have been in the process of converting to the Faith. Where would Theophilus have received his initial information and instruction about the Christian faith? The most likely answer is that a group of Christians living nearby had influenced and taught Theophilus. Luke was writing, not only to Theophilus, but also to those Christians who had given Theophilus his initial interest in Christianity.

Even so, Luke would only address both of these important works to a minor Roman official, if Luke were living in the area ruled by that official when he was writing. Since Acts of the Apostles was most likely written sometime during the two years after Paul arrived for his appeal to the emperor (see below), the Gospel of Luke was also written about that same time. At other times, Luke had been traveling with Paul and would not have been in one place, where Theophilus held office, for the length of time needed to write his Gospel. Thus the Gospel of Luke was written early in that two-year period of time and Acts of the Apostles was written in the latter part of those two years.

Luke's Gospel and Acts are both addressed to the same Roman official, Theophilus. Luke uses the formal term “most excellent” to address Theophilus in his Gospel (Lk 1:3). This language was commonly used in addressing Roman officials. Examples of this same expression are found in Acts, where it is used to address both Felix and Festus (Acts 24:2; 26:25). But, at the beginning of Acts, Luke no longer calls Theophilus “most excellent Theophilus,” instead he calls him “O Theophilus” (Lk 1:3; Acts 1:1). This indicates that Theophilus was no longer in office by the time that Luke was writing, or had completed writing, Acts. Yet Luke still addresses Acts to Theophilus. Luke must still have been living in the same area, where Theophilus still had continued respect and some unofficial authority. Minor Roman officials often held office for only a year. Theophilus could have been proconsul of Achaia, the region in which Saint Jerome tells us Luke was living when he wrote the Gospel, or he could have held some other office within the region of Achaia or Boeotia, (but there is no direct historical evidence as to where Theophilus held office).

Why would Almighty God allow two inspired works of Sacred Scripture to be addressed to a minor Roman official named Theophilus? From a spiritual point of view, the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles were both addressed to the name 'Theophilus' because of the meaning of that name, not because of the individual with that name. The name Theophilus means “one who loves God;” 'Theo' refers to God (as in 'Theology'), and 'philus' is from the Greek word 'philos' meaning 'to love.' So, Luke's Gospel is addressed, in the spiritual sense, not to one Roman official, but to all those who love God. Luke's Gospel was not written only or primarily for the Hebrews, who converted to Christ, but for all who love God, including the Gentiles. 

Where Were Luke's Gospel and Acts Written?

In Acts of the Apostles, Luke records many events that he himself either witnessed or learned directly from Paul. Acts ends abruptly at a point in time two years after Paul had been in Rome, preaching the Gospel, but guarded by a Roman soldier (Acts 28:16, 30). If Luke were living in a major Christian community during those two years, such as in Rome, Jerusalem, or Antioch, he would likely have included events occurring within that community. Yet Luke has little to say about those two years. Perhaps, then, Luke spent those two years in relative isolation from the larger Christian community, not traveling from place to place as he formerly did with Paul. He could have been living in a small town, some distance from Rome and other major centers of Christianity, focusing on writing.

Acts describes nothing beyond Paul's two-year stay in Rome, even though a number of significant events occurred not long afterwards, including the martyrdoms of James the Less and Mark the Evangelist. Neither does Luke record the outcome of Paul's appeal before the emperor. Thus, we may reasonably conclude that Acts was completed about two years after Paul arrived in Rome, not at any later date. Luke may have spent much of those two years working on his Gospel and on Acts of the Apostles. He may have had some portion of Acts written in advance (notes he had taken along the way and the like). However, this two-year period of time is the most likely time frame for the writing of the bulk of Acts and for its completion.

Not much detail is given about Paul's activities in Rome during those two years (Acts 28:30-31). Luke gives us great detail and precision in the order and timing of the events in the latter part of Acts (e.g. Acts 28:11-15), but he has very little to say about the two years described by Acts 28:30-31; he uses only one sentence to describe two whole years. Luke was with Paul when he arrived in Rome (Acts 28:16), but Luke must have lived somewhere distant from Rome for the greater part of those two years. Otherwise, he would have had some communication with Paul and more information to give about Paul's first two years in Rome.

From Acts 27:1 to the end of Acts, Luke uses the first person plural, “we,” to describe events which he and Paul and perhaps others experienced together. But in the last sentence of Acts, the one describing the first two years that Paul spent in Rome, Luke changes from using “we” to using “he” (Paul) and also refers to Rome with the word “there.” Acts ends with this sentence: “And he lived there two whole years at his own expense….” (Acts 28:30). This choice of words implies that Luke was elsewhere at the time of those two years.

Luke wrote the Gospel and Acts while he was living in the same location. He addressed both his Gospel and Acts to Theophilus because he was living in the region where Theophilus was, at first, a Roman official with formal authority, and later, a former Roman official who still retained some degree of respect and unofficial authority. Luke was also writing for the group of Christians who influenced Theophilus to become interested in Christ.

According to Saint Jerome, Saint Luke wrote the Gospel while living in the region of Achaia. “He was himself a disciple of the Apostle Paul, and composed his book in Achaia and Boeotia.” (Jerome, The Commentaries, Matthew). Achaia is the ancient region roughly in the location of modern-day Greece. Boeotia is a region within Greece, just northeast of the Gulf of Corinth. It is still referred to as Boeotia today. This location makes sense in the context of the other information we have about Luke. He was not in Rome with Paul during those two years mentioned at the end of Acts. Luke gives very little information about that two-year period of time because Luke was living far from Rome. He also was not in the center of any large Christian community (he lived some distance from Corinth); otherwise he might have added events from that community to the two years described at the end of Acts of the Apostles. Theophilus must have been a Roman official with authority within the area of Boeotia, where Luke was living when he wrote his Gospel and Acts.

When Were Luke's Gospel and Acts Written?

In my book, Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, I conclude that those two whole years must have been early A.D. 44 to early A.D. 46, that is, until early in the 7th year of Nero. (Note that, in my revised chronology of Christ's life, He was born in 15 B.C. and crucified in A.D. 19.) As concluded above, the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles were both most likely written during these first two years that Paul spent in Rome, between early A.D. 44 and early A.D. 46.

Which Language Did Luke Use?

Luke wrote both his Gospel and Acts for Theophilus and the Christians who influenced him to take an interest in Christ. Theophilus is a Greek name. The ending “us” is a Latinization of the Greek word 'philos,' just as the “us” in Josephus is a Latinization of the name Joseph (a Hebrew name). But the words 'Theo' and 'philos' are Greek words. Therefore, Theophilus is a Latinized Greek name and Theophilus himself was of Greek decent. Though he was an official in the Roman empire, Theophilus was probably raised in Greek culture, learning first and foremost the Greek language. As a Roman official, he also must have known some Latin.

The Christians who influenced Theophilus were also most likely Greek. They lived in the same area as Theophilus, in Boeotia of Greece. Theophilus may have known some of these Christians through family, social, or cultural connections within Greek society. Most people at that time in history were illiterate or minimally-literate. Thus, most of the Christians around Theophilus could speak the Greek language, but they were less than fluent when reading or writing Greek. This adds to the explanation as to why Luke addressed his books to Theophilus; it was partly because Theophilus had a role of authority and leadership, but also partly because most other persons in that group were less literate than he was.

Luke was a well-educated Gentile Christian, who was a physician. As a Christian without a Hebrew or Jewish background, Luke would have had minimal literacy in the Hebrew language. He would have been able to speak Aramaic, as this was one of the most dominant spoken languages of his day (and he traveled extensively). But his most fluent written languages were Latin and Greek. These two languages were the languages of ancient scholarship; works in Latin and in Greek competed for the attention of scholars.

Clearly, Luke's Gospel and Acts had to be written in the Greek language. This conclusion is not based on the fact that the oldest extant manuscripts of those books are in Greek. Nor is it based on the (mostly unexamined) premise of many modernist scholars that all the books of the New Testament were written in Greek. This conclusion is based on the idea that an author of a book of the New Testament would write in a language which he knew well and which his intended audience would know well.

The Title of Luke's Gospel and Acts

Luke appears to have given neither his Gospel, nor Acts of the Apostles, a title. He wrote two short works, for Theophilus and the small group of Christians who influenced him; Luke did not expect these works to be “published” or widely circulated. In modern terms, the Gospel of Luke and Acts are each like a long personal letter, which was not originally intended by the author to be seen by many persons. Luke perhaps intended that only Theophilus and a few other persons in his circle of Christian friends would read and benefit from his works. That is why he never gave either work a title.

\periph Intro to John
The Writing of the New Testament - John and Revelation 

Which Language?

Which languages were used in writing the Synoptic Gospels? Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Hebrew, because Matthew was writing for the Christians of Judea, who were mostly converts from Judaism. Mark's Gospel was written in Latin, because Mark was writing for the Christians of Rome, whose first language was Latin. Luke's Gospel was written in Greek, because Luke was writing for Theophilus (a Roman ruler, of Greek descent, living and ruling in Greece), and probably also for those Greek Christians who had nurtured Theophilus' interest in Christ.

John's Gospel was written in Asia (western Turkey), for the people of that area. John wrote his Gospel last, many years after the other Gospels were written, so he certainly knew of the other Gospels. He knew they had become important works within the all the churches. He knew that they were used in defending Christianity against Jews who did not convert to Christ and against heresy. He wrote primarily for the Christians of Asia, but he also knew that his Gospel would likely find a hearing in many churches in other areas of the world.

Knowing these things, which language would John choose? The Christians of Turkey during that period of time (first century A.D.) were a diverse group. Some were converts from Judaism, but many were non-Jews who became Christians. And John knew that he was, in effect, writing to Christians throughout the Church. Which language would be understood throughout the Church during that time period? Hebrew, Latin, and Greek each were well-known languages. Any major city would have some persons who could read those languages. But John knew, at that point in time, that the Gospels were mostly spoken aloud. They were read aloud at liturgical services. They were used in verbal arguments with Jews and with heretics.

Aramaic was one of the most common spoken languages. Jews in Israel used Aramaic as their daily spoken language, even if they were literate and could read and write Hebrew. And many Jews abroad used Aramaic. The language was widely used outside of Israel, even among non-Jews. It was a necessary language for commerce because the trade routes around the Mediterranean passed through Israel and other Aramaic-speaking regions. A Gospel in Aramaic would be understood when read aloud to groups of Christians, even by those who were illiterate.

A writer of any book of the New Testament would have to chose a language which would be understood by his audience and which he himself could speak and write fluently. John grew up in Israel during the first century A.D. and so he spoke Aramaic as his daily language. He was a young man when he first followed Christ. “As this disciple was known to the high priest, he entered the court of the high priest along with Jesus, while Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and brought Peter in.” (Jn 18:15-16). He was known to the Jewish high priest, so he was probably from a Jewish family which lived in or near Jerusalem (where the high priest lived). And he must have studied under the direction of Jewish priests. He would therefore have learned to read and write fairly well, and his best written language would be Hebrew. Sine Aramaic and Hebrew share the same alphabet and are similar in other respects, John would also have been able to read and write Aramaic.

The strict Jewish teachers of Jerusalem would not be teaching their students to read and write in Greek. The Hebraic Jews did not get along well with the Greek-speaking Jews. For example, when the Jews defined their canon of Scripture, they chose Hebrew books (of the Old Testament), not the Greek versions found in the Septuagint. (In part, this decision led to a division among Christians as to which books are canonical in the Old Testament.) John was not fluent in Greek. He may have picked up some Latin, since he grew up in an area dominated by the Romans, but Greek was the language he knew least well.

John wrote his Gospel in Aramaic because it was a widely-used spoken language and because John himself was fluent in Aramaic. John knew that the other Gospels were widely-circulated and that they were primarily read aloud in liturgical services and used in verbal debates. John did not know Greek well enough to write his Gospel, as well as the Book of Revelation, in that language. John's audience did not have Greek as their first and best spoken or written language. John wrote in Aramaic, not in Greek.

Hebrew was not chosen because John wrote at a much later date than Matthew. Early in Church history, most Christians were converts from Judaism. But John wrote between 49 and 62 years after Christ's Ascension (see Important Dates in the Lives of Jesus and Mary, p. 280). By that time, many more Christians were non-Jews. The community of believers came to realize that they were a separate religion from Judaism. John uses the expression “the Jews” in his Gospel, emphasizing that difference. John was not writing primarily for Hebraic Christians, as was Matthew, so John did not write in Hebrew.

Latin was not chosen because most Christians were not Romans. Though some had converted from among the Roman people, the Church at that time was not predominantly comprised of Latin-speaking Romans. The churches of Asia had Christians who were from many different cultures, and so did the Church as a whole. Though Asia was within the Roman empire, it was not mainly Roman. The area had a mix of cultures and languages. Aramaic was the one language most likely to be known by the Christians of every group, even if it was not the first language of some.

John chose Aramaic because it was the most common spoken language for his audience. Latin, Greek, and Hebrew were the dominant written languages of the peoples living around the Mediterranean. But most people were illiterate. And the Gospels were most often read aloud for groups of persons, rather than read privately for personal study. John needed a spoken language which everyone could understand. Compare this situation for John's Gospel with the situation for Luke's Gospel. Luke was writing to a small group, primarily to Theophilus, then also to those Christians who influenced him. His work was meant to be read, rather than spoken, so Luke used the written language which his audience would best understand, Greek. Theophilus was a Roman official, but of Greek descent; he probably knew both Latin and Greek well. His circle of Christians also knew Greek well. By contrast, John used the spoken language his wider and more varied audience would best understand, Aramaic.

Another reason John wrote in Aramaic is that his Gospel has long discourses of Jesus speaking. For example, John 6 and John 14 to 16 contain little narrative material; these chapters consist mostly of the words of Jesus. Yet these sections also avoid using a series of brief sayings on many diverse topics, as seen, for example, in Matthew 5. Instead, John presents long discourses by Jesus on a few related topics. Since Jesus taught in Aramaic, John was more likely to write long passages of Jesus' own words in Aramaic. The language of Aramaic was the best fit for this type of writing because it was the language of the One speaking.

Unique Position

John was in a unique position compared to the other Gospel writers. He knew that the Gospels written by Matthew, Mark, and Luke had become widely-used throughout the Church. The synoptic writers probably did not realize that their Gospels would be used beyond the limited areas and groups of their intended audiences. Matthew wrote for the Jewish converts to Christianity living in Judea. Mark wrote for the Christians of Rome. Luke wrote for Theophilus and the group of Christians surrounding him in Greece. But John, writing at a much later date, realized that he was addressing the entire Church on earth. In other words, John understood that he was writing a Gospel for the whole Church. This understanding must have had a profound effect what he wrote and how he presented it.

The Contribution of John's Disciples

The persons who completed John's Gospel are generally referred to as John's disciples. This term is a short-hand description of a fairly complex situation. This group may have included some persons who knew John personally and studied the faith under his direction. It may have included some who heard John preach, but did not know him or receive instruction from him personally; these merely knew John from a distance, yet did hear him speak about the faith. It may have included some who were more like disciples of John's disciples, rather than disciples of John himself; some of these may never have known John, but learned about him from others and sought to imitate him. Let's call this diverse group: “John's disciples.”

After John finished writing His Gospel, some person or persons made additions to his work. John's Gospel was not written by only one person. The text shows that more than one person put their hand to this Gospel. For example, the story of the woman caught in adultery is lacking in some ancient copies of John's Gospel. And some commentators have pointed out differences of language and style in that story. Also, the ending of John's Gospel clearly indicates at least one other person contributed to this inspired book of Sacred Scripture.
The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?” This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. (John 21:23-25).
Notice that verse 23 not only speaks about John in the third person, but also in a way which shows some distance of time and place between the writer and “this disciple.” This disciple is John, but the writer of verse 23 is clearly not John. Furthermore, which verse would John choose as a fitting ending for his Gospel? He begins his Gospel with a clear and piercing note about the Eternal Word of God. Would he then have ended his Gospel with a denial of rumors about his own mortality (verse 23), a statement referring to himself and the truth of his own testimony (verse 24), and a comment about how many books would be needed to put the deeds of Christ into written words (verse 25)? Clearly, these last verses were added by another hand at a later time.

Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name. (Jn 20:30-31).

John 20:30-31 is similar to John 21:25; both verses are later additions by John's disciples. Both are a commentary on the Gospel of John as a whole. An author would not generally add to his own work a commentary on itself. This type of writing shows the hand of a second author.

John probably ended his Gospel with the story about Peter and Christ, where Peter matches his previous triple denial of Christ with a triple affirmation of love for Christ (Jn 21:15-17). Then Jesus makes a prediction that Peter will suffer imprisonment because of the Gospel (Jn 21:18). John's disciples added the comment: “This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.” (Jn 21:19). Though, even by the late date that John himself wrote, Peter had already suffered martyrdom for Christ. John then concluded his Gospel with the sentence: “And after this he said to him, 'Follow me.' ” (Jn 21:19). John 21:20-23 is an additional story about John added by his disciples, which they had received from him, either directly or indirectly. John would not have ended with a story about himself. John 21:24-25 is commentary by John's disciples.

The next story is about John and uses the expression, “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” Again, this is the mark of a second hand being put to this Gospel. It seems unlikely that John would conclude his Gospel by talking about himself. The Holy Spirit chose to conclude the Gospel with these words, by inspiring these later additions to John's work; but John himself did not make that choice. All such additions or changes made to John's Gospel by his disciples are still the inspired work of God, because they God is their One True Author. John, out of humility and a desire to focus on Christ, would not have emphasized the things that he himself did. But John's disciples, knowing of these events either from John directly or as these stories were handed down to them, would add these events about him, about someone whom they admired because he lived like Christ and taught them the Faith.

In fact, all of the references to “the disciple whom Jesus loved” may be later additions by John's disciples of material which they heard from John verbally, in sermons or in personal instruction, or which was handed down to them. John was not likely to refer to himself as “the disciple whom Jesus loved,” but the Holy Spirit allowed his disciples to refer to him this way as a symbolic way to refer to all disciples who are loved by Christ. John does refer to himself in his Gospel, for example:
“Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he entered the court of the high priest along with Jesus, while Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and brought Peter in.” (Jn 18:15-16)
Here John calls himself by the humble expressions, “another disciple,” “this disciple,” “the other disciple.” He does not call himself “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” John himself wrote this passage about Peter inside the court of the high priest. John was present for this event and wrote about it. By contrast, the passage from John 13:23-25 is the work of John's disciples, who emphasize John's role: “One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying close to the breast of Jesus; so Simon Peter beckoned to him and said, 'Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.' So lying thus, close to the breast of Jesus, he said to him, 'Lord, who is it?' ” (Jn 13:23-25).

By comparison, in another passage, John 20:1-10, we have a combination of John's work, with later additions by his disciples. In this passage, John repeatedly calls himself, “the other disciple.” His disciples then add the phrase, “the one whom Jesus loved.” If the disciples had written the whole passage, they would have said, “the disciple whom Jesus loved” as one phrase. But since they are adding to the earlier existing work, they leave in the phrase “the other disciple” and then start again by saying “the one whom Jesus loved.” The result is the somewhat awkward phrasing: “...and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved….” (Jn 20:2). These disciples are also probably the ones who pointed out that John outran Peter and reached the tomb first. John is less likely, and his disciples are more likely, to point out anything superlative that John himself did.

The passage in John 21, where the disciples are fishing, presents a similar situation. John wrote the passage and he referred to himself, within the list of those who went fishing, with the mere phrase “the sons of Zebedee.” But his disciples probably added the line: “That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, 'It is the Lord!' ” Then we resume John's original storyline with Peter jumping out of the boat to run to Christ.

Other lines which clearly show the work of a subsequent author are those which comment on the text. For example, some verses count up the previous events: “This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.” (Jn 21:14). This line indicates that a second hand was put to John's Gospel. The later author is counting up events in the text and adding an observation of the text itself; something the original author is much less likely to do. An exception to this rule is the three denials by Peter and the three affirmations also by Peter. This count is integral to the event itself and obvious to the original author. It is not a commentary on the text.

The Translation of John into Greek

One other obvious mark of a second author stands out in John's Gospel. In several places, John's Gospel uses a word, then immediately explains its meaning with one other word. Examples of this include:
And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” (Jn 1:38).
“We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). (Jn 1:40).
“So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter). (Jn 1:42).
“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). (Jn 9:7).
She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). (Jn 20:16).
These are all examples of the clarification of an Aramaic or Hebrew term by giving the Greek equivalent. This is clearly the work of a translator, not the original author. If John were writing in Greek, he would simply use the corresponding Greek word for each word spoken by Christ or a disciple. Only a later translator would leave in the original wording and then add an explanatory comment, providing the translation of a word which the translator's audience might not know. John's audience knew Aramaic and some Hebrew. But the later audience which John's disciples were addressing, when they translated his Gospel into Greek, might not.

Why would John's disciples make any additions to the Gospel written by the Apostle they admired? Would they not have treasured his words without making any changes? Translating John's Gospel into Greek gave them the opportunity to work with this Gospel. This group of disciples admired the Apostle John and sought to imitate him. As they were working on translating his Gospel, it was natural for them to add to John's Gospel those teachings which they had received from John or which had been handed down from John. They did not see this as altering or adding to John's teachings. They were merely writing down more of what John himself taught.

Translators often mix their own interpretations and point of view into their translation. John's disciples, likewise, did not merely translate, they also interpreted, e.g. Jn 21:19a and Jn 20:30-31, and they even added other material, which came directly or indirectly from John, to the Gospel of John.

The Book of Revelation

John's second work, the Book of Revelation, was also written in Aramaic. John was writing to much the same audience as with his Gospel. First, he was writing again for the churches of Asia (i.e. western Turkey): “John to the seven churches that are in Asia….” (Rev 1:4). He also realized that, as with his Gospel, this type of religious writing often found a wider circulation in the Church. The book of Revelation is not only about the seven churches of Asia, it is also about the future of the Church and the world. Numerous passages refer to the earth as a whole or to a large portion of the earth, for example: “its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth,” and “the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,” and “I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth,” and many other such passages (Rev 6:4, 12; 7:1). It must have been very clear to John that God intended this message for the whole Church. Therefore, John again chose a language which, at the time, would be understood in each of the seven churches of Asia and also throughout the Church, namely, Aramaic.

Some commentators claim that Revelation must have been written in Greek, because John quotes God saying: “I am the Alpha and the Omega” (Rev 1:8). But this does not necessarily imply that the words were spoken to John by God in Greek. For example, Acts of the Apostles was written in Greek, yet Paul (Saul) tells us that Christ spoke to him on the road to Damascus in Hebrew (Acts 26:14). God could have spoken to John in Hebrew, in which case the “I am” would use similar wording to the “I am who am” of the Old Testament. Or God could have spoken to John in Aramaic. Both Hebrew and Aramaic have similar alphabets. The first letter of the Aramaic alphabet is Alap, and in Hebrew it is Aleph; the last letter in Aramaic is Tau, and in Hebrew it is Tof. Thus, this sentence becomes either, in Aramaic, “I am the Alap and the Tau,” or, in Hebrew, “I am the Aleph and the Tof.” An astute translator would realize that his Greek-speaking audience might not know what Aleph and Tof meant. Rather than give an awkward explanation within the text: “I am the Aleph (first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) and the Tof (last letter of the Hebrew alphabet),” the translation to the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet is smoother and clearer: “I am the Alpha and the Omega.” Perhaps the English translation could read: “I am the A and the Z.”

John's Disciples and Revelation

Again we see that John's disciples could not resist adding to John's work as they translated it into Greek. In the first three verses of Revelation, we have a commentary on the work similar to the commentary in the last two verses of John's Gospel. Again, in the third verse of Revelation, we have a comment by John's disciples about the last days, similar to a comment at the end of John's Gospel. Both the end of John's Gospel and the beginning of Revelation refer to John bearing witness and to his testimony. And both refer to the end times. John 21:23 refers to Christ's return, and Revelation 1:3 tells us, “the time is near.”

These similarities suggests that John's disciples worked on translating and adding to Revelation just after their work on John's Gospel. They still had the same mind set. For example, a writer working on one book might have different ideas, attitudes, and approaches to the same material. On one day, or on consecutive days, he might approach the material from one angle. But, writing for the same work weeks or months later, he might take a different approach and express somewhat different ideas or attitudes. The similarities between the end of John's Gospel and the start of Revelation suggest that there was not much time between the work John's disciples did with the Gospel and their work with Revelation.

If John had originally written Revelation in Greek, then his disciples would have had no reason to work with the book and to make any additions to the material. The continuity between the work his disciples did on the Gospel and their work on Revelation suggests that they were translating Revelation just as they had translated the Gospel.

When the Apostle John wrote Revelation, he began with: “John, to the seven churches that are in Asia….” (Rev 1:4). The ending of Revelation, as originally written by John, is difficult to discern. In Rev. 22:10-11, John brings to a close his description of his interaction with the angel who helped convey this revelation from God. The next verse, Rev 22:12, repeats one of the themes of Rev 1:3, the nearness of the Return of Christ. And the subsequent verse, Rev 22:13, repeats and expounds upon the earlier “Alpha and Omega” statement. These would seem to be additions by John's disciples. The remainder of the book could well be additions by John's disciples, but such additions are not mere inventions of his disciples. Instead, these words and ideas are drawn by John's disciples from John's teachings as they had been handed down to his disciples.

The Antichrist's Number

In Revelation, a number is given which is associated with the Antichrist: “This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six.” (Rev 13:18) The footnote to the RSV of this passage states: “Other ancient authorities read six hundred sixteen.” This number, 666, is often thought to represent the name of the Antichrist. 

The ancient languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin used letters to represent numbers. In Greek, the number 666 is represented by three letters, the first letter represents 600, the second letter represents 60, and the third symbol represents 6; it is likewise for the number 616. But, in Aramaic, the representation of the numbers 666 and 616 is different in one important respect. Aramaic represents 600 with two letters, the symbol for 400 and the symbol for 200; used together, these two symbols mean 600.

The number given in Rev. 13:18 stands for the number of letters in the Antichrist's name: 666 stands for the 6 letters of his first name, the 6 letters of his middle name, and the 6 letters of his last name, and 616 stands for the 6 letters of his first name, the 1 letter of his middle initial, and the 6 letters of his last name. But, if the number 600 was written as, essentially, 400-200, then his first (or last?) name would be 6 letters divided into four letters and two letters, perhaps separated with a hyphen.

The Close of the Canon

When was the canon of Sacred Scripture closed? Some commentators say that this occurred when the last of the Apostles, John, died. But it is clear that John's Gospel and the Book of Revelation were completed, by one or more of John's disciples, sometime after John's death. They write as if John were no longer present among them. And John wrote the book of Revelation towards the end of his life. Also, his disciples were adding to these books at a later time, when there was a need for a Greek translation of the books. The translation occurred some significant length of time after John's death. The portions of the these books written by John's disciples are a part of Sacred Scripture and were most likely written after John died, therefore the canon of Sacred Scripture was not closed upon John's death, but upon the completion of each of the books within the canon.

The Letters of John

The Epistles of John were not written by John the Apostle, but by John the elder. The latter John is clearly imitating the former, yet he does not mention John the Apostle by name nor does he recount any of the Apostle's recent deeds. John the elder seems to be writing a significant length of time after John the Apostle's death. Either the Epistles of John the elder, or the Gospel and Revelation of John, could have been the last of the books of Sacred Scripture to be written. Paul, Peter, and James were each martyred prior to the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian. John wrote Revelation while in exile on the island of Patmos (Rev 1:9); he was exiled their by Domitian, “on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus,” in other words, because he wrote the word of God in the Gospel, as a testimony of Jesus. Since Paul, Peter, and James all died prior to the reign of Domitian, they wrote their Epistles before John wrote his Gospel and Revelation. This leaves the last words of the Bible to have been written by either the author of the Epistles of John the elder or the disciples of John the Apostle, who completed his Gospel and the book of Revelation. And with those last words, the canon of Sacred Scripture was closed (though not permanently).

The Influence of the Virgin Mary

After the Ascension of Christ to Heaven, Saint John the Evangelist, one of the Twelve Apostles, took care of the Virgin Mary. “And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.” (Jn 19:27). During the 15 years from Christ's Ascension to Mary's Assumption, John spent more time with the Virgin Mary than did any of the other Apostles or Gospel writers. A devout disciple of Christ who spends much time with the Virgin Mary could not help but learn much about Christ from his holy Mother and closest Imitator. For this reason, the Gospel of John was undoubtedly influenced by the Virgin Mary. She did not write the Gospel of John, nor was she even living on earth when it was written. The Gospel of John was written long after Mary's Assumption to Heaven. Yet her influence is unmistakable within the depth and breadth of the understanding of Christ found in the fourth Gospel. John's depth of knowledge about Christ came in part from his long friendship with the Virgin Mary.

The Request to Write

Saint Jerome describes the circumstances surrounding the writing of the Gospel of John:
“When he was in Asia, at the time when the seeds of heresy were springing up (I refer to Cerinthus, Ebion, and the rest who say that Christ has not come in the flesh, whom he in his own epistle calls Antichrists, and whom the Apostle Paul frequently assails), he was urged by almost all the bishops of Asia then living, and by deputations from many Churches, to write more profoundly concerning the divinity of the Saviour, and to break through all obstacles so as to attain to the very Word of God (if I may so speak) with a boldness as successful as it appears audacious. Ecclesiastical history relates that, when he was urged by the brethren to write, he replied that he would do so if a general fast were proclaimed and all would offer up prayer to God; and when the fast was over, the narrative goes on to say, being filled with revelation, he burst into the heaven-sent Preface: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God: this was in the beginning with God.' ”
Like the other Gospel writers, it was not John's idea to write a Gospel. He wrote it upon the fervent request of the Bishops and the faithful of the churches in Asia (modern-day Turkey). Perhaps a few of the “deputations from many Churches,” which Jerome mentions, were even from outside of Asia. John wrote the Gospel after the faithful prayed and fasted on behalf of his task. The Gospel of John was the answer to those prayers.

The Title

The Gospels of Matthew and Mark each have titles, expressed in modern versions as the first verse of each. The Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles lack a title, because these works were more like long letters to some friends (Theophilus and the Christians associated with him), and less like a book or published work. The Gospel of John is a different case. Matthew and Mark each wrote for the Christians of a particular area; Matthew wrote for the Christians of Judea and Mark for the Christians of Rome. They did probably did not know that they each were writing a Gospel which would be circulated throughout in all the Churches. Saint John was asked to write a Gospel. By that time, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke had long been published and circulated among the churches. John knew that he was writing a Gospel. He understood, better than the Synoptic authors, how such writings were being used by the various churches. He probably realized that it would be read even outside of the churches of Asia.

John began his Gospel with a Prologue, but not with a title. He did not title the Gospel because he realized, more so that the other Evangelists, that he was writing a Gospel. This work did not need a title because it is the written Word of God. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” (Jn 1:1).

The Writing of the New Testament - The Epistles of John 

The Epistles of John the Elder
“He wrote also one Epistle which begins as follows 'That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes and our hands handled concerning the word of life' which is esteemed of by all men who are interested in the church or in learning. The other two of which the first is 'The elder to the elect lady and her children' and the other 'The elder unto Gaius the beloved whom I love in truth,' are said to be the work of John the presbyter to the memory of whom another sepulchre is shown at Ephesus to the present day, though some think that there are two memorials of this same John the evangelist.” (Saint Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, 9)
Who Wrote the Epistles of John?

According to Saint Jerome, John the Apostle and Gospel writer wrote the first of these three Epistles and John the Presbyter (or Elder) wrote the other two. I disagree. The textual evidence clearly points to the same author for all three of the Epistles of John. 

First, there is significant evidence that John the Elder existed and was a Christian leader of some influence. As Jerome recounts, there were two sepulchers at Ephesus, one to the memory of John the Apostle and the other to the memory of John the Elder. Papias, “the pupil of John, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia,” also mentions the elder John as a different individual from John the Gospel writer (Saint Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, 18). 

In Sacred Scripture, we find that two of the three Epistles of John each have the author of referring to himself as “the elder.” The Second Letter of John begins: “The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth....” (2 John 1:1). The Third Letter of John begins: “The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.” (3 John 1:1). But in the Gospel of John, whenever John must refer to himself, he does not call himself the elder. This fact, in itself, might be dismissed for two reasons. The Gospel of John is not a letter, and so the Gospel writer might refer to himself differently than he would in a letter. And, during the events described in the Gospel of John, the Gospel writer was then a young man, without the age or position in the Church that would warrant the term “elder.” 

However, the Revelation to John is, more or less, a type of letter, written and addressed like a letter: “John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace....” (Rev 1:4). Such wording is similar to many of Paul's letters, which begin with Paul stating his name and the name of the church or person to whom he is writing, and with a Christian greeting such as 'grace and peace to you.' The Book of Revelation was written by John in the form of a letter, at a time late in his life, after he had written a Gospel at the request of the Bishops and the people of the churches in Asia (western Turkey). John was writing a letter at a time when he was a kind of elder, with age and authority in the Church, yet he does not refer to himself as “the elder.” Therefore, the Second and Third Letters of John were not written by John the Apostle, but by John the Elder.

John the Elder did not have as much authority or support among the people in the various churches as John the Apostle did. John, late in his life, was the last surviving member of the Twelve Apostles, the writer of a Gospel at the request of various churches, and a much revered person throughout the Church on earth. John the Apostle would not have had the problem described in the Third Letter of John: “I have written something to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge my authority.” (3 John 1:9) The writer of this Third Letter is clearly not the same John as the Gospel writer. Since the introduction of the Second and Third Letters of John each state that the author is “the elder,” both of these letters are from John the Elder, not John the Apostle and Gospel writer.

John the Elder's letters have been mistaken for the work of John the Gospel writer because they use some of the same themes and expressions found in the fourth Gospel. But this use of common themes and expressions does not mean that John the Apostle wrote these Letters. Any faithful disciple of that time period, living in Asia, would have had a special connection with, and love for, the fourth Gospel, since it was written particularly for the people of that region. It was probably not uncommon for the disciples of that time and place to imitate John the Apostle in his life and in his words. He lived among the disciples of that region and taught the Gospel in person for many years after Christ's Ascension and after the deaths of the other Apostles. Thus, John the Elder's imitation of John the Apostles words is understandable and fitting.

John the Elder uses similar themes and expressions to John the Apostle, but there are also significant differences which indicate that the one author is not the other. This situation is similar to a comparison of two paintings, the one by a well-known painter, and the other by a student of his, whose work is both an imitation of and a digression from the work of his teacher. It is not necessary for me to point out the similarities and differences between these two author's works. Interested students of Scripture can read and notice these things for themselves quite easily. Also, much of the differences and similarities is found not merely in particular words or expressions, but in the overall feel and sense of these texts. One must read it for one's self.

The First Letter of John clearly has differences of word and expression from the Gospel and Revelation, just like the other two letters. It also has an important point of similarity to the Second Letter of John: both letters use the term “antichrist.” In the Second Letter, this mention is brief: “such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.” (2 John 1:7). In the First Letter, this mention is more extensive: “and you have heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come.... This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.” (1 John 2:18,22). Then later, the First Letter returns to this idea: “and every spirit, which does not confess Jesus, is not of God. This is the spirit of the antichrist....” (1 John 4:3). Both letters use the term “antichrist,” a term not found in the Gospel of John, nor in the Book of Revelation.

John the Apostle repeatedly refers to the antichrist and his deeds at length in the Book of Revelation. Chapter 13 of Revelation is clearly about the antichrist, as is Rev. 19:20. Yet John never uses the term “antichrist.” The Book of Revelation was completed by some of John's disciples, who clearly added material to the book, yet they never use the term antichrist either. If John had used such a term, even in verbal teachings, his disciples would likely use the term when they edited the Book of Revelation. But no such term appears in Revelation. On the other hand, the First Letter of John uses the term “antichrist” repeatedly, even though it is a shorter work, less concerned with the time of the antichrist and with future events. Therefore, John the Apostle was not the author of the First Letter of John. All three Letters of John were written by John the Elder. 

The letters of John the Elder were written at a later date than Revelation. By that time, Christians would have had an opportunity to reflect on the teachings of John the Apostle, especially that of Revelation. And they would have had some experience with the heresy and apostasy in the early Church (against which John the Apostle was writing). The term 'antichrist' then developed out of that reflection and experience. Thus, John the Apostle speaks at length about the Antichrist, but does not use the term, because that term had not yet developed in the Church. But John the Elder, writing at a later date, does use the term. He also shows an increased understanding about the Antichrist, a kind of development of doctrine about the Antichrist, which came from the Church's reflection on the prior writings of John the Apostle.

The Second Letter of John is addressed from “the elder” to “the elect lady,” in other words, to a church located in some town, or, more specifically, to a small community of Christians, away from the larger churches of the well-populated areas. For a small community, being called “the elect lady” would mean that they, too, are a church of Christ and a bride of Christ. Whereas, a larger community of Christians would not need to be encouraged with an expression that indicates they one of the churches. Also, notice that John the Elder writes: “I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children following the truth....” He would not rejoice greatly to find that “some” of the children of a church in a large city are following the truth. It would be more insult than complement to say such to a large group of Christians in a well-established church. But such words would be fitting praise and encouragement for a new, smaller group of Christians. Near the end of this letter, John the Elder writes that he would prefer to visit them and talk to them in person, rather than write a long letter. This preference fits the idea that they are a new small group of Christians. They do not have many teachers among them; they need someone in person to teach them at length.

The Third Letter of John is addressed from “the elder” to “Gaius.” This man seems to belong to a different group of Christians than those of the Second Letter. The Second Letter addresses a small group who need instruction and seem somewhat isolated from the other churches. The Third Letter address a somewhat larger group that is much less isolated. This group of Christians receives members from other churches, when they “render any service to the brethren, especially to strangers, who have testified to your love before the church.” (3 John 1:5). Thus, they receive visitors from other churches, whom they have not met before, who then go on to testify to the presence of Christ in their midst. Later verses also refer to visits from other churches to this church (3 John 1:10). The last verse mentions friends who the Christians of this church know, who are with John the Elder, and other friends who are known by John to be among this church: “The friends greet you. Greet the friends, every one of them.” (3 John 1:15). Again, this indicates a larger church with connections to other groups of Christians.

In the Third Letter, John the Elder states: “I have written something to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge my authority.” (3 John 1:9). John the elder wrote something, with authority, not merely a letter of greeting and friendship. But one man, named Diotrephes, resisted John's teaching in that letter. The letter referred to is not the Second Letter, which is to a different group of Christians. Rather, it is most likely a teaching letter, of some length, expressing various theological ideas, against which Diotrephes argues. And it is probably not merely another letter to this same group, addressed by way of one of their leaders, Gaius. For this other letter is written “to the church,” in other words, to believers in general. It is a letter from John the Elder, addressed not to any one group or individual, which teaches at some length about the faith. The First Letter of John fits this description. It was written by John the Elder, but he does not begin by referring to himself as “the elder” and then by referring to the person or group he addresses. In this case, because he is addressing the whole church, he simply begins to teach. The First Letter is one of theological teaching, whereas the Second and Third Letters are more ones of personal greeting and encouragement in the Faith. Thus, all three of the Letters of John were written by John the Elder, not John the Apostle and Gospel writer.
