\mt1 The Prophecy of Isaiah
\im This inspired writer is called by the Holy Ghost, the great prophet, (Ecclesiasticus 48.25,) from the greatness of his prophetic spirit, by which he hath foretold so long before, and in so clear a manner, the coming of Christ, the mysteries of our redemption, the calling of the Gentiles, and the glorious establishment, and perpetual flourishing of the church of Christ: insomuch that he may seem to have been rather an evangelist than a prophet. His very name is not without mystery; for Isaiah in Hebrew signifies the salvation of the Lord, or Jesus is the Lord. He was, according to the tradition of the Hebrews, of the blood royal of the kings of Juda: and after a most holy life, ended his days by a glorious martyrdom; being sawed in two, at the command of his wicked son in law, King Manasses, for reproving his evil ways.
\c 1
\cl Isaiah 1
\cd The prophet complains of the sins of Juda and Jerusalem, and exhorts them to a sincere conversion.
\v 1 ¶ The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Joatham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\v 2 ¶ Listen, O heavens, and pay attention, O earth, for the Lord has spoken. I have nurtured and raised children, but they have spurned me.
\v 3 An ox knows his owner, and a donkey knows the manger of his lord, but Israel has not known me, and my people have not understood.
\v 4 Woe to a sinful nation, a people burdened by iniquity, a wicked offspring, accursed children. They have abandoned the Lord. They have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel. They been taken away backwards.
\v 5 For what reason shall I continue to strike you, as you increase transgressions? The entire head is feeble, and the entire heart is grieving.
\v 6 From the sole of the foot, even to the top of the head, there is no soundness within. Wounds and bruises and swelling sores: these are not bandaged, nor treated with medicine, nor soothed with oil.
\v 7 Your land is desolate. Your cities have been set ablaze. Foreigners devour your countryside in your sight, and it will become desolate, as if devastated by enemies.
\v 8 And the daughter of Zion will be left behind, like an arbor in a vineyard, and like a shelter in a cucumber field, and like a city being laid to waste.
\v 9 If the Lord of hosts had not bequeathed us offspring, we would have been like Sodom, and we would have been comparable to Gomorrah.
\v 10 ¶ Listen to the Word of the Lord, you leaders of the people of Sodom. Listen closely to the law of our God, O people of Gomorrah.
\v 11 The multitude of your sacrifices, what is that to me, says the Lord? I am full. I do not desire holocausts of rams, nor the fat of fatlings, nor the blood of calves and of lambs and of he-goats.\f + \fr 1:11 \ft The sacrifices of the Old Testament were meant to be offered with internal devotion, so as to benefit the ones offering the sacrifices, not to benefit God. Without internal devotion, the externals of the law become useless.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 12 When you approach before my sight, who is it that requires these things from your hands, so that you would walk in my courts?
\v 13 You should no longer offer sacrifice in vain. Incense is an abomination to me. The new moons and the Sabbaths and the other feast days, I will not receive. Your gatherings are iniquitous.
\v 14 My soul hates your days of proclamation and your solemnities. They have become bothersome to me. I labor to endure them.
\v 15 And so, when you extend your hands, I will avert my eyes from you. And when you multiply your prayers, I will not heed you. For your hands are full of blood.
\v 16 Wash, become clean, take away the evil of your intentions from my eyes. Cease to act perversely.
\v 17 Learn to do good. Seek judgment, support the oppressed, judge for the orphan, defend the widow.
\v 18 ¶ And then approach and accuse me, says the Lord. Then, if your sins are like scarlet, they shall be made white like snow; and if they are red like vermillion, they shall become white like wool.
\v 19 If you are willing, and you listen to me, then you will eat the good things of the land.
\v 20 But if you are not willing, and you provoke me to anger, then the sword will devour you. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
\v 21 ¶ How has the faithful city, full of judgment, become a harlot? Justice lived in her, but now murderers.
\v 22 Your silver has turned into dross. Your wine has been mixed with water.
\v 23 Your leaders are unfaithful, the associates of thieves. They all love gifts; they pursue rewards. They do not judge for orphans, and the widow’s case is not brought before them.
\v 24 Because of this, the Lord God of hosts, the Strength of Israel, says: Ah! I will be consoled over my enemies, and I will be vindicated from my adversaries.
\v 25 And I will turn my hand to you. And I will temper your dross unto purity, and I will take away all your tin.
\v 26 And I will restore your judges, so that they will be as before, and your counselors as in times long past. After this, you shall be called the City of the Just, the Faithful City.
\v 27 Zion will be redeemed in judgment, and they will lead her back to justice.
\v 28 ¶ And he shall crush the accursed and sinners together. And those who have abandoned the Lord will be consumed.
\v 29 For they shall be confounded because of the idols, to which they have sacrificed. And you shall be ashamed over the gardens that you chose,
\v 30 when you were like an oak with falling leaves, and like a garden without water.
\v 31 And your strength will be like the embers from stubble, and your work will be like a spark, and both will burn together, and there will be no one to extinguish it.
\c 2
\cl Isaiah 2
\cd All nations shall flow to the church of Christ. The Jews shall be rejected for their sins. Idolatry shall be destroyed.
\v 1 ¶ The word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 2 And in the last days, the mountain of the house of the Lord will be prepared at the summit of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and all the nations shall flow to it.\f + \fr 2:2 \fk The last days: \ft The whole time of the new law, from the coming of Christ till the end of the world, is called in the scripture the last days; because no other age or time shall come after it, but only eternity.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 2:2 \fk On the top of mountains, etc: \ft This shews the perpetual visibility of the church of Christ: for a mountain upon the top of mountains cannot be hid.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 3 And many peoples will go, and they will say: “Let us approach and ascend to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob. And he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For the law will go forth from Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
\v 4 And he will judge the nations, and he will rebuke many peoples. And they shall forge their swords into plowshares, and their spears into sickles. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they continue to train for battle.\f + \fr 2:4 \ft A plowshare is the cutting blade of the plow, analogous to the blade of a sword.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 5 ¶ O house of Jacob, let us approach and walk in the light of the Lord.
\v 6 For you have cast aside your people, the house of Jacob, because they have been filled up, as in past times, and because they have had soothsayers as the Philistines have, and because they have joined themselves to foreign servants.
\v 7 Their land has been filled with silver and gold. And there is no end to their storehouses.
\v 8 And their land has been filled with horses. And their four-horse chariots are innumerable. And their land has been filled with idols. They have adored the work of their hands, which their own fingers have made.
\v 9 And man has bowed himself down, and so man has become debased. Therefore, you should not forgive them.
\v 10 ¶ Enter into the rock, and hide in a ditch in the soil, from the presence of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.
\v 11 The lofty eyes of man have been humbled, and the haughtiness of men will be bowed down. Then the Lord alone shall be exalted, in that day.
\v 12 For the day of the Lord of hosts will prevail over all the proud and self-exalted, and over all the arrogant, and each one shall be humbled,
\v 13 and over all the straight and tall cedars of Lebanon, and over all the oaks of Bashan;
\v 14 and over all the lofty mountains, and over all the elevated hills;
\v 15 and over every lofty tower, and over every fortified wall;
\v 16 and over all the ships of Tarshish, and over all the beauty that may be seen.
\v 17 And the loftiness of men will be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men will be brought low. And the Lord alone shall be exalted, in that day.
\v 18 And idols will be thoroughly crushed.\f + \fr 2:18 \fk Idols shall be utterly destroyed: \ft or utterly pass away. This was verified by the establishment of Christianity. And by this and other texts of the like nature, the wild system of some modern sectaries is abundantly confuted, who charge the whole Christian church with worshipping idols, for many ages.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 19 ¶ And they will go into the caves of the rocks, and into the caverns of the earth, from the presence of the dread of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he will have risen up to strike the earth.
\v 20 In that day, man shall cast aside his idols of silver and his images of gold, which he had made for himself, as if to reverence the moles and the bats.\f + \fr 2:20 \ft The last phrase is figurative. Mankind puts aside idols of the past, only to hide in the rocks and the ground, like moles and bats. So, it is as if mankind is appealing to the moles and the bats, instead of the Lord.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 21 And so he will go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the caverns of stone, from the presence of the dread of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he will have risen up to strike the earth.
\v 22 ¶ Therefore, rest away from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he considers himself to be exalted.
\c 3
\cl Isaiah 3
\cd The confusion and other evils that shall come upon the Jews for their sins. The pride of their women shall be punished.
\v 1 ¶ For behold, the sovereign Lord of hosts will take away, from Jerusalem and from Judah, the powerful and the strong: all the strength from bread, and all the strength from water;\f + \fr 3:1 \ft The word ‘robor’ refers not only to strength, but to a source of strength, such as bread and water.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 2 the strong man, and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the seer and the elder;
\v 3 the leader over fifty and the honorable in appearance; and the counselor, and the wise among builders, and the skillful in mystical speech.
\v 4 And I will provide children as their leaders, and the effeminate will rule over them.
\v 5 And the people will rush, man against man, and each one against his neighbor. The child shall rebel against the elder, and the ignoble against the noble.
\v 6 For a man will apprehend his brother, from the household of his own father, saying: “The vestment is yours. Be our leader, but let this ruin be under your hand.”
\v 7 In that day, he will respond by saying: “I am not a healer, and there is no bread or vestment in my house. Do not choose to appoint me as a leader of the people.”
\v 8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah has fallen, because their words and their plans are against the Lord, in order to provoke the eyes of his majesty.
\v 9 The acknowledgement of their countenance is their response. For they have proclaimed their own sin, like Sodom; and they have not concealed it. Woe to their souls! For evils are being repaid to them.
\v 10 ¶ Tell the just man that it is well, for he shall eat from the fruit from his own plans.
\v 11 Woe to the impious man immersed in evil! For retribution will be given to him from his own hands.
\v 12 As for my people, their oppressors have despoiled them, and women have ruled over them. My people, who call you blessed, the same are deceiving you and disrupting the path of your steps.
\v 13 ¶ The Lord stands for judgment, and he stands to judge the people.
\v 14 The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and with their leaders. For you have been devouring the vineyard, and the plunder from the poor is in your house.
\v 15 Why do you wear down my people, and grind up the faces of the poor, says the Lord, the God of hosts?
\v 16 ¶ And the Lord said: Because the daughters of Zion have been lifted up, and have walked with extended necks and winking eyes, because they have continued on, walking noisily and advancing with a pretentious stride,
\v 17 the Lord will make the heads of the daughters of Zion bald, and the Lord will strip them of the locks of their hair.
\v 18 In that day, the Lord will take away their decorative shoes,
\v 19 and the little moons and chains, and the necklaces and bracelets, and the hats,
\v 20 and the ornaments for their hair, and the anklets, and the touches of myrrh and little bottles of perfumes, and the earrings,\f + \fr 3:20 \ft The Latin word ‘murenulas’ does not make sense in this context unless it is actually the word ‘murrenulas,’ pertaining to small amounts of myrrh. Since the next term is ‘olfactoriola,’ which refers to small amounts of perfume or fragrant resins, this is probably the correct reading.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 21 and the rings, and the jewels hanging on their foreheads,
\v 22 and the continual changes in appearance, and the short skirts, and the fine linens and embroidered cloths,\f + \fr 3:22 \ft The word ‘mutatoria’ refers to things that change, which in the modern context would include frequent changes of style, of clothing, and of jewelry, and perhaps even plastic surgery, all of which changes one’s appearance for the sake of vanity. The word palliola could be translated as little hood, or little cape, but in the context of modern clothing, short skirt is probably more applicable. The word ‘acus’ refers to a long needle used to make embroidered cloth; a similar pin was also used in women’s hair. But since the previous word refers to a type of cloth, the translation ‘embroidery’ is better than ‘needle’ or ‘hair pin.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 23 and the mirrors, and scarves, and ribbons, and their sparse clothing.\f + \fr 3:23 \ft The word ‘theristra’ refers to thin cloth worn in summer time, hence the translation ‘sparse clothing.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 24 And in place of a sweet fragrance, there will be stench. And in place of a belt, there will be a rope. And in place of stylish hair, there will be baldness. And in place of a blouse, there will be haircloth.
\v 25 Likewise, your most handsome men will fall by the sword, and your strong men will fall in battle.
\v 26 And her gates will grieve and mourn. And she will sit on the ground, desolate.
\c 4
\cl Isaiah 4
\cd After an extremity of evils that shall fall upon the Jews, a remnant shall be comforted by Christ.
\v 1 ¶ And seven women will take hold of one man, in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing, only let us be called by your name, so as to take away our reproach.”
\v 2 ¶ In that day, the seedling of the Lord will have magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth will be greatly-esteemed and a source of joy to those who will have been saved out of Israel.\f + \fr 4:2 \fk The bud of the Lord: \ft That is, Christ.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 3 And this shall be: all who are left behind in Zion, and who remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, all who have been written in life in Jerusalem.\f + \fr 4:3 \ft The meaning of the expression ‘omnis qui scriptus est in vita in Ierusalem’ is somewhat obscure. Bible translators should not try to take away all of the obscurity of the sacred texts, because in doing so they do violence to the many different levels of meaning of Scripture and so discourage the search for truth among readers of the Bible. Passages which are obscure in the source text should perhaps remain somewhat obscure in translation, lest the translator substitute his own limited understanding for the ineffable source of truth which is Sacred Scripture.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 4 Then the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have washed away the blood of Jerusalem from its midst, by means of a spirit of judgment and a spirit of intense devotion.
\v 5 And the Lord will create, over every place of Mount Zion and wherever he is called upon, a cloud by day and a smoke with the splendor of burning fire by night. For protection will be over every glory.
\v 6 And there will be a tabernacle for shade from the heat in daytime, and for security, and for protection from the whirlwind and from rain.
\c 5
\cl Isaiah 5
\cd The reprobation of the Jews is foreshewn under the parable of a vineyard. A woe is pronounced against sinners: the army of God shall send against them.
\v 1 ¶ I will sing to my beloved the canticle of my paternal cousin, about his vineyard. A vineyard was made for my beloved, at the horn in the son of oil.\f + \fr 5:1 \ft The word ‘patruelis’ refers to a father’s brother’s son. The phrase “in cornu filio olei” is correctly translated in the original Douai version, and also in the Wycliffe translation: “in the horn in the son of oil”. At first glace, this translation might not seem to make sense. But the word ‘horn’ was used to describe an area of land (perhaps irregularly shaped) that would be at the extremity of a larger parcel of land. It might be a raised area, since higher ground is better for growing plants (in that it drains well and warms quickly). This vineyard belonged to the father’s brother’s son, so it would have been divided to him from out of a larger parcel. So which part of the larger area of land was he given? It was a choice area, which was termed ‘the son of oil,’ in other words, the most productive part of the vineyard.\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 5:1 \fk My cousin: \ft So the prophet calls Christ, as being of his family and kindred, by descending from the house of David.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 5:1 \fk On a hill, etc: \ft Literally, in the horn, the son of oil.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 2 And he fenced it in, and he picked the stones out of it, and he planted it with the best vines, and he built a tower in the middle of it, and he set up a winepress within it. And he expected it to produce grapes, but it produced wild vines.\f + \fr 5:2 \ft The word ‘labruscas’ refers not so much to wild grapes, but to wild grape vines, which would be much less productive than the domesticated vines selected and bred for productivity.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 3 Now then, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah: judge between me and my vineyard.
\v 4 What more should I have done for my vineyard that I did not do for it? Should I not have expected it to produce grapes, though it produced wild vines?
\v 5 And now, I will reveal to you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away its fence, and it will be plundered. I will pull down its wall, and it will be trampled.
\v 6 And I will make it desolate. It will not be pruned, and it will not be dug. And briers and thorns will rise up. And I will command the clouds not to rain upon it.
\v 7 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel. And the man of Judah is his delightful seedling. And I expected that he would do judgment, and behold iniquity, and that he would do justice, and behold an outcry.
\v 8 ¶ Woe to you who join house to house, and who combine field to field, even to the limits of the place! Do you intend to live alone in the midst of the earth?
\v 9 These things are in my ears, says the Lord of hosts. Otherwise, many houses, great and beautiful, will become desolate, without an inhabitant.
\v 10 Then ten acres of vineyard will produce one small bottle of wine, and thirty measures of seed will produce three measures of grain.
\v 11 ¶ Woe to you who rise up in the morning to pursue drunkenness, and to drink even until evening, so as to be inflamed with wine.
\v 12 Harp and lyre and timbrel and pipe, as well as wine, are at your feasts. But you do not respect the work of the Lord, nor do you consider the works of his hands.
\v 13 Because of this, my people have been led away as captives, for they did not have knowledge, and their nobles have passed away from famine, and their multitudes have dried up from thirst.
\v 14 For this reason, Hell has expanded its soul, and has opened its mouth without any limits. And their strong ones, and their people, and their exalted and glorious ones will descend into it.\f + \fr 5:14 \ft The term ‘infernus’ could also be translated in a more general way, referring to death more generally, and not necessarily to Hell.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 15 And man will be bowed down, and man will be humbled, and the eyes of the exalted will be brought low.
\v 16 And the Lord of hosts will be exalted in judgment, and the holy God will be sanctified in justice.
\v 17 And the lambs will pasture in proper order, and new arrivals will eat from the deserts turned into fertile lands.
\v 18 Woe to you who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and who draw sin as if with the rope of a cart,
\v 19 and who say: “Let him hurry, and let his work arrive soon, so that we may see it. And let the plan of the Holy One of Israel approach and arrive, so that we may know it.”
\v 20 ¶ Woe to you who call evil good, and good evil; who substitute darkness for light, and light for darkness; who exchange bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\v 21 ¶ Woe to you who are wise in your own eyes, and prudent in your own sight!
\v 22 ¶ Woe to you who are powerful at drinking wine, who are strong men in contriving inebriation!
\v 23 For you justify an impious man in exchange for bribes, and you carry away the justice of a just man from him.
\v 24 Because of this, as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the heat of a flame burns it completely, so will their root become like glowing embers, and so will their offshoot ascend like dust. For they have cast aside the law of the Lord of hosts, and they have blasphemed the eloquence of the Holy One of Israel.
\v 25 For this reason, the fury of the Lord has been enraged against his people, and he has extended his hand over them, and he has struck them. And the mountains were disturbed. And their carcasses became like dung in the midst of the streets. After all this, his fury was not turned away; instead, his hand was still extended.
\v 26 And he will lift up a sign to nations far away, and he will whistle to them from the ends of the earth. And behold, they will rush forward speedily.
\v 27 There is no one weak or struggling among them. They will not become drowsy, and they will not sleep. Neither will the belt around their waist be loosened, nor the laces of their boots be broken.
\v 28 Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are taut. The hoofs of their horses are like flint, and their wheels are like the force of a tempest.
\v 29 Their roaring is like the lion; they will roar like young lions. They will both roar and seize their prey. And they will wrap themselves around it, and there will be no one who can rescue it.
\v 30 And in that day, they will make a noise over it, like the sound of the sea. We will gaze out toward the land, and behold, the darkness of the tribulation, and even the light has been darkened by its gloom.
\c 6
\cl Isaiah 6
\cd A glorious vision, in which the prophet’s lips are cleansed: he foretells the obstinacy of the Jews.
\v 1 ¶ In the year in which king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, sublime and exalted, and the things that were under him filled the temple.
\v 2 The Seraphim were standing above the throne. One had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they were covering his face, and with two they were covering his feet, and with two they were flying.
\v 3 And they were crying out to one another, and saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts! All the earth is filled with his glory!”
\v 4 And the lintels above the hinges were shaken at the voice of the one crying out. And the house was filled with smoke.
\v 5 And I said: “Woe to me! For I have remained silent. For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live in the midst of a people having unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King, the Lord of hosts!”
\v 6 And one of the Seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a burning coal, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
\v 7 And he touched my mouth, and he said, “Behold, this has touched your lips, and so your iniquities will be taken away, and your sin will be cleansed.”
\v 8 ¶ And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send?” and, “Who will go for us?” And I said: “Here I am. Send me.”
\v 9 And he said: “Go forth! And you shall say to this people: ‘When you listen, you will hear and not understand. And when you see a vision, you will not comprehend.’
\v 10 Blind the heart of this people. Make their ears heavy and close their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and then I would heal them.”
\v 11 ¶ And I said, “For how long, O Lord?” And he said, “Until the cities are desolate, without an inhabitant, and the houses are without a man, and the land will be left behind, deserted.”
\v 12 For the Lord will take the men far away, and she who will have been left behind will be multiplied in the midst of the earth.
\v 13 But still, there will be a tithing within her, and she will be converted, and she will be put on display, like a terebinth tree and like an oak which extends its branches. And what will remain standing within her will be a holy offspring.
\c 7
\cl Isaiah 7
\cd The prophet assures king Achaz that the two kings his enemies shall not take Jerusalem. A virgin shall conceive and bear a son.
\v 1 ¶ And it happened in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the king of Judah, that Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, ascended to Jerusalem to battle against it. But they were not able to defeat it.
\v 2 And they reported to the house of David, saying: “Syria has withdrawn to Ephraim.” And his heart was shaken, with the heart of his people, just as the trees of the forest are moved by the face of the wind.
\v 3 ¶ And the Lord said to Isaiah: Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son, Jashub, who was left behind, to the end of the aqueduct, at the upper pool, on the road to the fuller’s field.
\v 4 And you shall say to him: “See to it that you are silent. Do not be afraid. And have no dread in your heart over the two tails of these firebrands, nearly extinguished, which are the wrath of the fury of Rezin, king of Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.”
\v 5 For Syria has undertaken a plan against you, with the evil of Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying:
\v 6 “Let us ascend to Judah, and stir it up, and tear it away for ourselves, and appoint the son of Tabeel as a king in its midst.”
\v 7 Thus says the Lord God: This shall not stand, and this shall not be.
\v 8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years from now, Ephraim will cease to be a people.
\v 9 For the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you will not continue.
\v 10 ¶ And the Lord spoke further to Ahaz, saying:
\v 11 Ask for a sign for yourself from the Lord your God, from the depths below, even to the heights above.
\v 12 And Ahaz said, “I will not ask, for I will not tempt the Lord.”
\v 13 And he said: “Then listen, O house of David. Is it such a small thing for you to trouble men, that you must also trouble my God?
\v 14 For this reason, the Lord himself will grant to you a sign. Behold, a virgin will conceive, and she will give birth to a son, and his name will be called Immanuel.
\v 15 He will eat butter and honey, so that he may know to reject evil and to choose good.
\v 16 But even before the boy knows to refuse evil and to choose good, the land that you detest will be abandoned by the face of her two kings.
\v 17 The Lord will lead over you, and over your people, and over the house of your father, such days as have not occurred since the days of the separation of Ephraim from Judah by the king of the Assyrians.
\v 18 And this shall be in that day: the Lord will call for the fly, which is in the most distant parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the swarm, which is in the land of Assur.\f + \fr 7:18 \ft Assur was a false god of Assyria.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 19 And they will arrive, and they all will rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the caverns of the rocks, and in every thicket, and in every opening.
\v 20 ¶ In that day, the Lord will shave with a razor the ones hired by those who are across the river, by the king of the Assyrians, from the head to the hairs of the feet, with the entire beard.\f + \fr 7:20 \ft The word ‘conducta’ can refer to those hired to do a job, or to hired soldiers (mercenaries).\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 21 And this shall be in that day: a man will raise a cow among oxen, and two sheep,
\v 22 and, instead of an abundance of milk, he will eat butter. For all who are left behind in the midst of the land will eat butter and honey.
\v 23 And this shall be in that day: every place, where there were a thousand grapevines worth a thousand pieces of silver, will become thorns and briers.
\v 24 They will enter such places with arrows and bows. For briers and thorns will be throughout the entire land.
\v 25 But as for all the mountains, which will be dug with a hoe, the terror of thorns and briers will not approach those places. And there will be pasture land for oxen, and a range for cattle.”

\cl Isaiah 8
\cd The name of a child that is to be born: many evils shall come upon the Jews for their sins.
\v 1 ¶ And the Lord said to me: “Take up for yourself a large book, and with a man’s pen write in it: ‘Take away the spoils quickly; plunder swiftly.’ ”
\v 2 And I summoned to myself faithful witnesses: Uriah, the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Berechiah.
\v 3 And I joined with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the Lord said to me: “Call his name: ‘Rush to take away the spoils; Hurry to be plundered.’
\v 4 For before the boy knows how to call to his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be taken away, in the sight of the king of the Assyrians.”
\v 5 ¶ And the Lord spoke to me further, saying:
\v 6 “Because this people has cast aside the waters of Shiloah, which go forth silently, and has instead chosen Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
\v 7 for this reason, behold, the Lord will lead over them the waters of a river, strong and plentiful: the king of the Assyrians with all his glory. And he will rise up throughout all his streams, and he will overflow all his banks.\f + \fr 8:7 \ft The king of the Assyrians is a figure of the Antichrist.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 8 And he will pass through Judah, inundating it, and he will cross over and arrive, even at its neck. And he will extend his wings, filling the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.”
\v 9 ¶ O people, gather together, and be conquered! All distant lands, listen! Be strengthened, and be conquered! Gird yourselves, and be conquered!
\v 10 Undertake a plan, and it will be dissipated! Speak a word, and it will not be done! For God is with us.
\v 11 For the Lord said this to me, and he has instructed this to me with a strong hand, lest I go forth in the way of this people, saying:
\v 12 “You should not say ‘It is conspiracy!’ For all that this people speaks is a conspiracy. And you should not be frightened or alarmed with their fear.
\v 13 Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself. Let him be your dread, and let him be your fear.
\v 14 And so shall he be a sanctification to you. But he will be a stone of offense and a rock of scandal to the two houses of Israel, and a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 15 And very many of them will stumble and fall, and they will be broken and entangled and seized.
\v 16 Bind the testimony, seal the law, among my disciples.”
\v 17 And I will wait for the Lord, who has concealed his face from the house of Jacob, and I will stand before him.
\v 18 Behold: I and my children, whom the Lord has given to me as a sign and a portent, in Israel, from the Lord of hosts, who lives on Mount Zion.
\v 19 And though they say to you, “Seek from seers and diviners,” they who hiss in their incantations, should not the people seek from their God, for the sake of the living, and not from the dead?\f + \fr 8:19 \ft The term ‘Numquid’ asks a question which expects a negative answer; but when ‘non’ is added, the expectation is of a positive answer. Since the answer to this question is expected to be ‘yes,’ the question refers to the true God (with a capital letter).\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 8:19 \fk Seek of pythons: \ft That is, people pretending to tell future things by a prophesying spirit.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 8:19 \fk Should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?: \ft Here is signified, that it is to God we should pray to be directed, and not to seek of the dead, (that is, of fortune-tellers dead in sin,) for the health of the living.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 20 And this is, moreover, for the sake of the law and the testimony. But if they do not speak according to this Word, then he will not have the morning light.
\v 21 And he will pass by it; he will fall and become hungry. And when he is hungry, he will become angry, and he will speak evil against his king and his God, and he will lift himself upward.
\v 22 And he will gaze downward to the earth, and behold: tribulation and darkness, dissolution and distress, and a pursuing gloom. For he will not be able to fly away from its distress.\f + \fr 8:22 \ft The distress referred to is that of the earth (feminine in Latin).\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 1 ¶ In the earlier time, the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali were lifted up. But in the later time, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, the Galilee of the Gentiles, was weighed down.
\v 2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. A light has risen for the inhabitants of the region of the shadow of death.
\v 3 You have increased the nation, but you have not increased the rejoicing. They will rejoice before you, like those who rejoice at the harvest, like the victorious exulting after capturing the prey, when they divide the spoils.
\v 4 For you have prevailed over the yoke of their burden, and over the rod of their shoulder, and over the scepter of their oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
\v 5 For every violent plunder with a tumult, and every garment mixed with blood, will be burned up and will become fuel for the fire.
\v 6 For unto us a child is born, and unto us a son is given. And leadership is placed upon his shoulder. And his name shall be called: wonderful Counselor, mighty God, father of the future age, Prince of Peace.
\v 7 His reign will be increased, and there will be no end to his peace. He will sit upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to confirm and strengthen it, in judgment and justice, from now even unto eternity. The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall accomplish this.
\v 8 ¶ The Lord sent a word to Jacob, and it fell upon Israel.
\v 9 And all the people of Ephraim will know it. And the inhabitants of Samaria will say it, in the arrogance and haughtiness of their heart:
\v 10 “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with squared stones. They have cut down the sycamores, but we will replace them with cedars.”
\v 11 And the Lord will raise up the enemies of Rezin over him, and he will turn his adversaries into a tumult:
\v 12 the Syrians from the east and the Philistines from the west. And they will devour Israel with their whole mouth. After all this, his fury was not turned away; instead, his hand was still extended.
\v 13 And the people did not return to the One who struck them, and they did not seek the Lord of hosts.
\v 14 And so, the Lord will disperse, away from Israel, the head and the tail, he who bows down and he who refrains, in one day.
\v 15 The long-lived and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.
\v 16 And those who deceitfully praise this people, and those who are praised, will be thrown down violently.
\v 17 For this reason, the Lord will not rejoice over their youths. And he will not take pity on their orphans and widows. For each one is a hypocrite, and each one is wicked, and every mouth has spoken foolishness. After all this, his fury was not turned away; instead, his hand was still extended.
\v 18 For impiety has been kindled like a fire: it will devour brier and thorn, and it will burn in the dense forest, and it will be interwoven with the ascending smoke.
\v 19 The earth has been shaken by the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and the people will become like fuel for the fire. A man will not spare his own brother.
\v 20 And he will turn toward the right, and he will be hungry. And he will eat toward the left, and he will not be satisfied. Each one will eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, and together they will be against Judah.

\v 3 What will you do on the day of visitation and calamity which is approaching from afar? To whom will you flee for assistance? And where will you leave behind your own glory,
\v 4 so that you may not be bowed down under the chains, and fall with the slain? Concerning all this, his fury was not turned away; instead, his hand was still extended.
\v 5 ¶ Woe to Assur! He is the rod and the staff of my fury, and my indignation is in their hands.\f + \fr 10:5 \ft The term Assur refers to a false Assyrian god, but also figuratively to the Antichrist (a false god from Assyria).\fl (Conte)\f*

But it shall not be so; in verse 12 we are told that God will act against him (Assur).\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 9 “Are not my princes like many kings? Is not Calno like Carchemish, and Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
\v 10 In the same manner as my hand reached the kingdoms of the idol, so also will it reach their false images, those of Jerusalem and of Samaria.
\v 11 Should I not do to Jerusalem and her false images, just as I have done to Samaria and her idols?”
\v 12 And this shall be: when the Lord will have completed each of his works on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will act against the fruit of the exalted heart of king Assur, and against the glory of the haughtiness of his eyes.
\v 13 For he has said: “I have acted with the strength of my own hand, and I have understood with my own wisdom, and I have removed the limits of the people, and I have plundered their leaders, and, like one with power, I have pulled down those residing on high.
\v 14 And my hand has reached to the strength of the people, as to a nest. And, just as the eggs which have been left behind are gathered, so have I gathered the entire earth. And there was no one who moved a wing, or opened a mouth, or uttered a snarl.”
\v 15 Should the axe glorify itself over him who wields it? Or can the saw exalt itself over him who pulls it? How can a rod lift itself up against him who wields it, or a staff exalt itself, though it is only wood?
\v 16 Because of this, the sovereign Lord, the Lord of hosts, will send leanness among his fat ones. And under the influence of his glory, a burning ardor will rage, like a consuming fire.
\v 17 And the light of Israel will be like a fire, and the Holy One of Israel will be like a flame. And his thorns and briers will be set ablaze and devoured, in one day.
\v 18 And the glory of his forest and of his beautiful hill will be consumed, from the soul even to the flesh. And he will flee away in terror.

\v 20 ¶ And this shall be in that day: those not added to the remnant of Israel, and those who escape of the house of Jacob, will not lean upon him who strikes them. Instead, they will lean upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
\v 21 The remnant of Jacob, again I say the remnant, will be converted to the mighty God.
\v 22 For though your people, O Israel, will be like the sand of the sea, yet only a remnant of them will be converted. The consummation, having been shortened, will be inundated with justice.\f + \fr 10:22 \ft This is just as Christ himself said, that if those days has not been shortened no one would survive.

\v 23 For the Lord, the God of hosts, will accomplish an abbreviation and a consummation, in the midst of all the earth.
\v 24 For this reason, the Lord, the God of hosts, says this: “My people, who inhabit Zion: do not be afraid of Assur. He will strike you with his rod, and he will lift up his staff over you, on the way of Egypt.

\v 4 On the mountains, there is the voice of a multitude, as if of a numerous people, a voice with the sound of kings, of nations gathered together. For the Lord of hosts has given orders to soldiers of war,
\v 5 to those who are arriving from a far off land, from the heights of the heavens. It is the Lord and the instruments of his fury, so that he may bring ruin to all the earth.

\v 8 Writhing and pain will seize them. They will be in pain, like a woman in labor. Each one will appear stupefied to his neighbor. Their countenances will be like faces which have been burned up.
\v 9 Behold, the day of the Lord approaches: a cruel day, full of indignation and wrath and fury, which will place the earth in solitude and crush the sinners from it.
\v 10 For the stars of the heavens, in their splendor, will not display their light. The sun will be obscured at its rising, and the moon will not shine in her brightness.
\v 11 And I will act against the evils of the world, and against the impious for their iniquity. And I will cause the pride of the unfaithful to cease, and I will bring down the arrogance of the strong.
\v 12 A man will be more precious than gold, and mankind will become like pure refined gold.
\v 13 For this purpose, I will stir up heaven, and the earth will be moved from its place, because of the indignation of the Lord of hosts, because of the day of his furious wrath.
\v 14 And they will be like a doe fleeing away, or like sheep; and there will be no one who may gather them together. Each one will turn to his own people, and every one will flee to his own land.

\v 4 My fugitives will live with you. Become a hiding place, O Moab, from the face of the destroyer. For the dust is at its end; the miserable one has been consumed. He who trampled the earth has failed.
\v 5 And a throne will be prepared in mercy, and One shall sit upon it in truth, in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and quickly repaying what is just.
\v 6 ¶ We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud. His pride and his arrogance and his indignation is more than his strength.
\v 7 For this reason, Moab will wail to Moab; each one will wail. Speak of their wounds to those who rejoice upon the brick walls.
\v 8 For the suburbs of Heshbon are deserted, and the lords of the Gentiles have cut down the vineyard of Sibmah. Its vines have arrived even at Jazer. They have wandered in the desert. Its seedlings have been abandoned. They have crossed over the sea.
\v 9 I will weep with the tears of Jazer over this, the vineyard of Sibmah. I will inebriate you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh! For the sound of those who trample has rushed over your vintage and over your harvest.
\v 10 And so, rejoicing and exultation will be taken away from Carmel, and there will be no jubilation or exultation in the vineyards. He who was accustomed to tread will not tread out the wine in the winepress. I have taken away the sound of those who tread.\f + \fr 16:10 \fk Carmel: \ft This name is often taken to signify a fair and fruitful hill or field, such as mount Carmel is.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 11 Over this, my heart will resonate like a harp for Moab, and my inner most being for the brick wall.
\v 12 And this shall be: when it is seen that Moab has struggled upon his high places, he will enter his holy places to pray, but he will not prevail.
\v 13 This is the word that the Lord has spoken to Moab concerning that time.
\v 14 And now the Lord has spoken, saying: In three years, like the years of a hired hand, the glory of Moab concerning the entire multitude of the people will be taken away, and what is left behind will be small and weak and not so numerous.

\v 2 The cities in ruin will be left for the flocks, and they will take rest there, and there will be no one who may terrify them.
\v 3 And assistance will cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom will cease from Damascus. And the remnant of Syria will be like the glory of the sons of Israel, says the Lord of hosts.
\v 4 And this shall be in that day: the glory of Jacob will be thinned, and the fatness of his flesh will be reduced.
\v 5 And it shall be like the gathering of the harvest which remains, and his arm will pick the ears of grain. And it shall be like a search for grain in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 6 And what is left behind in it will be like one cluster of grapes, or like a shaken olive tree with two or three olives at the top of a branch, or like four or five olives at the top of a tree, says the Lord God of Israel.
\v 7 In that day, a man will bow before his Maker, and his eyes will consider the Holy One of Israel.
\v 8 And he will not bow before the altars that his hands have made. And he will not consider the things that his fingers have made, the sacred groves and the shrines.
\v 9 In that day, his strong cities will be abandoned, like the plows and the grain fields which were left behind before the face of the sons of Israel, and you shall be deserted.\f + \fr 17:9 \fk That were left: \ft Viz., by the Chanaanites, when the children of Israel came into their land.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 5 For before the harvest, all was flourishing. And it will spring forth with an untimely completion, and its little branches will be pruned with a curved blade. And what is left over will be cut away and shaken off.
\v 6 And together they will be abandoned to the birds of the mountains and to the wild beasts of the earth. And the birds will be continuously on them in the summer, and all the wild beasts of the earth will winter over them.

\v 2 And I will cause Egyptian to rush against Egyptian. And they will fight: a man against his brother, and a man against his friend, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
\v 3 And the spirit of Egypt will be ruptured to its very core. And I will cast down their plan violently.

\v 7 The channel of the river will be stripped down to its source, and everything irrigated by it will dry up and wither and be no more.
\v 8 And the fishermen will grieve. And all who cast a hook into the river will mourn. And those who cast a net upon the surface of its waters will languish.

\v 13 The leaders of Tanis have become foolish. The leaders of Memphis have decayed. They have deceived Egypt, the corner of its people.

\v 15 And there will be no work for Egypt that would produce a head or a tail, one who bows down or one who refrains from bowing down.
\v 16 In that day, Egypt will be like women, and they will be stupefied and fearful before the presence of the shaking hand of the Lord of hosts, the hand which he will move over them.
\v 17 And the land of Judah will be a dread to Egypt. Everyone who thinks about it will be terrified before the presence of the plan of the Lord of hosts, the plan which he has decided concerning them.
\v 18 In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt which speak the language of Canaan, and which swear by the Lord of hosts. One will be called the City of the Sun.
\v 19 In that day, there will be an altar of the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a monument of the Lord beside its borders.

\v 3 Because of this, my lower back has been filled with pain, and anguish has possessed me, like the anguish of a woman in labor. I fell down when I heard it. I was disturbed when I saw it.
\v 4 My heart withered. The darkness stupefied me. Babylon, my beloved, has become a wonder to me.
\v 5 Prepare the table. Contemplate, from a place of observation, those who eat and drink. Rise up, you leaders! Take up the shield!
\v 6 For the Lord has said this to me: “Go and station a watchman. And let him announce whatever he will see.”
\v 7 And he saw a chariot with two horsemen, and a rider on a donkey, and a rider on a camel. And he considered them diligently, with an intense gaze.\f + \fr 21:7 \fk A rider upon an ass, etc: \ft These two riders are the kings of the Persians and Medes.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 4 For this reason, I said: “Depart from me. I will weep bitterly. Make no attempt to console me, over the devastation of the daughter of my people.”
\v 5 For it is a day of death, and of trampling, and of weeping to the Lord, the God of hosts, in the valley of vision: examining the wall and the magnificence above the mountain.

\v 11 And you have made a pit between two walls for the waters of the ancient fish-pool. But you have not gazed upward to him who made it, and you have not considered, even from a distance, its Maker.
\v 12 And in that day, the Lord, the God of hosts, will call to weeping and mourning, to baldness and the wearing of sackcloth.\f + \fr 22:12 \ft This refers to the Day of Repentance, i.e. the Warning of Garabandal, when God will call everyone to repentance.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 13 But behold: gladness and rejoicing, the killing of calves and the slaughter of rams, the eating of meat and the drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.”\f + \fr 22:13 \ft This refers to the reaction to the Warning by persons who reject sorrow for their own sins and the gift of repentance.

\v 1 ¶ In that day, this canticle will be sung in the land of Judah. Within it will be set the city of our strength: Zion, a savior, a wall with a bulwark.
\v 2 Open the gates, and let the just people who guard the truth enter.
\v 3 The old error has gone away. You will serve peace: peace, for we have hoped in you.
\v 4 You have trusted in the Lord for all eternity, in the Lord God almighty forever.
\v 5 For he will bend down those living in the heights. He will bring low the lofty city. He will lower it, even to the ground. He will tear it down, even to the dust.
\v 6 The foot will tread it down: the feet of the poor, the steps of the indigent.
\v 7 The path of the just is upright; the difficult path of the just is right to walk in.
\v 8 And in the path of your judgments, O Lord, we have endured for you. Your name and your remembrance are the desire of the soul.
\v 9 My soul has desired you in the night. But I will also watch for you with my spirit, in my inmost heart, from the morning. When you accomplish your judgments upon the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn justice.
\v 10 Let us take pity on the impious one, but he will not learn justice. In the land of the holy ones, he has done iniquity, and so he will not see the glory of the Lord.
\v 11 Lord, let your hand be exalted, and let them not see it. May the envious people see and be confounded. And may fire devour your enemies.
\v 12 Lord, you will give us peace. For all our works have been wrought for us by you.
\v 13 O Lord our God, other lords have possessed us apart from you, but in you alone let us remember your name.
\v 14 Let not the dead live; let not the giants rise up again. For this reason, you have visited and destroyed them, and you have perished all remembrance of them.
\v 15 You have been lenient to the people, O Lord, lenient to the people. But have you been glorified? You have removed all the limits of the earth.
\v 16 Lord, they have sought you in anguish. Your doctrine was with them, amid the tribulation of murmuring.
\v 17 Like a woman who has conceived and is approaching the time for delivery, who, in anguish, cries out in her pains, so have we become before your face, O Lord.
\v 18 We have conceived, and it is as if we were in labor, but we have given birth to wind. We have not brought forth salvation on the earth. For this reason, the inhabitants of the earth have not fallen.
\v 19 Your dead shall live. My slain will rise again. Be awakened, and give praise, you who live in the dust! For your dew is the dew of the light, and you shall be dragged down to the land of the giants, to ruination.
\v 20 ¶ Go, my people! Enter your chambers. Close your doors behind you. Conceal yourselves for a very brief time, until the indignation has passed over you.
\v 21 For behold, the Lord will go forth from his place, so that he may visit the iniquity of each inhabitant of the earth against him. And the earth will reveal its blood, and it will no longer cover its slain.\f + \fr 26:21 \fk Shall cover her slain no more: \ft This is said with relation to the martyrs, and their happy resurrection.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\cl Isaiah 27
\cd The punishment of the oppressors of God’s people. The Lord’s favour to his church.
\v 1 ¶ In that day, the Lord will visit, with his harsh and great and strong sword, against Leviathan, the barred serpent, and against Leviathan, the twisted serpent, and he will slay the whale that is in the sea.\f + \fr 27:1 \fk Leviathan: \ft That is, the devil, the great enemy of the people of God. He is called the bar serpent from his strength, and the crooked serpent from his wiles; and the whale of the sea, from the tyranny he exercises in the sea of this world. He was spiritually slain by the death of Christ, when his power was destroyed.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 2 In that day, the vineyard of pure wine will sing to them.\f + \fr 27:2 \fk The vineyard, etc: \ft The church of Christ.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 3 I am the Lord, who watches over it. I will suddenly give drink to it. I will watch over it, night and day, lest perhaps someone visit against it.\f + \fr 27:3 \fk I will suddenly give it drink: \ft Or, as the Hebrew may also be rendered, I will continually water it.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 4 Indignation is not mine. Who will be a thorn and a brier to me in battle? I will advance against them. I set them on fire together.\f + \fr 27:4 \fk No indignation in me, etc: \ft Viz., against the church: nor shall I become as a thorn or brier in its regard; or march against it, or set it on fire: but it shall always take fast hold of me, and keep an everlasting peace with me.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 5 Or will he, instead, take hold of my strength? Will he make peace with me? Will she make peace with me?\f + \fr 27:5 \ft The word ‘spinam’ is feminine and the word ‘veprem’ is masculine, hence the translation: “will he…will she….” The spine represents the false prophetess of the Book of Revelation, and the brier represents the Antichrist.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 6 As they advance with violence against Jacob, Israel will flourish and spring forth, and they will fill the face of the world with offspring.\f + \fr 27:6 \fk When they shall rush in, etc: \ft Some understand this of the enemies of the true Israel, that shall invade it in vain. Others of the spiritual invasion made by the apostles of Christ.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 7 Has he struck him with the scourge that he himself used to strike others? Or has he killed in the manner that he himself used to kill his victims?\f + \fr 27:7 \fk Hath he struck him, etc: \ft Hath God punished the carnal persecuting Jews, in proportion to their doings against Christ and his saints?\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 8 You will judge this by comparing one measure to another, when he has been cast out. He has decided this, by his stern spirit, for the day of heat.\f + \fr 27:8 \fk When it shall be cast off, etc: \ft When the synagogue shall be cast off, thou shalt judge it in measure, and in proportion to its crimes.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 27:8 \fk He hath meditated, etc: \ft God hath designed severe punishments in the day of his wrath.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 9 Therefore, concerning this, the iniquity of the house of Jacob will be forgiven. And this is the reward of all: that their sin be taken away, when he will have made all the stones of the altar to be like crushed cinders. For the sacred groves and the shrines shall not stand.\f + \fr 27:9 \fk Of the house of Jacob: \ft Viz., of such of them as shall be converted.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 10 For the fortified city will be desolate. The shining city will be abandoned and will be left behind like a desert. In that place, the calf will pasture, and in that place, he will lie down, and he will feed from its summits.\f + \fr 27:10 \fk The strong city: \ft Jerusalem.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 11 Its harvest will be crushed by dryness. Women will arrive and teach it, for it is not a wise people. Because of this, he who made it will not take pity on it, and he who formed it will not spare it.
\v 12 ¶ And this shall be: in that day, the Lord will strike, from the channel of the river, even to the torrent of Egypt. And you shall be gathered together, one by one, O sons of Israel.
\v 13 And this shall be: in that day, a noise will be made with a great trumpet. And those who had been lost will approach from the land of the Assyrians, with those who had been outcasts in the land of Egypt. And they will adore the Lord, on the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.\f + \fr 27:13 \fk A great trumpet: \ft The preaching of the gospel for the conversion of the Jews.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\cd The punishment of the Israelites, for their pride, intemperance, and contempt of religion. Christ the cornerstone.
\v 1 ¶ Woe to the crown of arrogance, to the inebriated of Ephraim, and to the falling flower, the glory of his exultation, to those who were at the top of the very fat valley, staggering from wine.\f + \fr 28:1 \fk Ephraim: \ft That is, the kingdom of the ten tribes.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 28:1 \fk The head of the fat valley: \ft Samaria, situate on a hill, having under it a most fertile valley.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 2 Behold, the Lord is powerful and steadfast, like a storm of hail, like a crushing whirlwind, like the force of many waters, inundating, sent forth over a spacious land.
\v 3 The arrogant crown of the inebriated of Ephraim will be trampled underfoot.
\v 4 And the falling flower, the glory of his exultation, who is at the summit of the fat valley, will be like a premature fruit before the ripeness of autumn, which, when the onlooker beholds it, as soon he takes it in his hand, he will devour it.
\v 5 ¶ In that day, the Lord of hosts will be the crown of glory and the wreath of exultation for the remnant of his people.
\v 6 And he will be the spirit of judgment for those who sit in judgment, and the strength of those who return from war to the gates.
\v 7 Yet truly, these also have been ignorant due to wine, and they have gone astray due to inebriation. The priest and the prophet have been ignorant because of inebriation. They have been absorbed by wine. They have staggered in drunkenness. They have not known the One who sees. They have been ignorant of judgment.\f + \fr 28:7 \fk These also: \ft The kingdom of Juda.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 8 For all the tables have been filled with vomit and filth, so much so that there was no place left.
\v 9 ¶ To whom will he teach knowledge? And to whom will he grant an understanding of what is heard? To those who have been weaned from the milk, who have been pulled away from the breasts.
\v 10 So then: command, and command again; command, and command again; expect, and expect again; a little here, and a little there.\f + \fr 28:10 \fk Command, command again, etc: \ft This is said in the person of the Jews, resisting the repeated commands of God, and still putting him off.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 11 For with the speech of lips and with a different language, he will speak to this people.
\v 12 He said to them: “This is my rest. Refresh the weary,” and, “This is my refreshment.” And yet they were unwilling to listen.
\v 13 And so, the word of the Lord to them will be: “Command, and command again; command, and command again; expect, and expect again; a little here, and a little there,” so that they may go forward and fall backward, and so that they may be broken and ensnared and captured.
\v 14 ¶ Because of this, listen to the word of the Lord, you mocking men, who lord it over my people who are at Jerusalem.
\v 15 For you have said: “We struck a deal with death, and we formed a pact with Hell. When the inundating scourge passes through, it will not overwhelm us. For we have placed our hope in lies, and we are protected by what is false.”
\v 16 ¶ For this reason, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will set a stone within the foundations of Zion, a tested stone, a cornerstone, a precious stone, which has been established in the foundation: whoever trusts in him need not hurry.\f + \fr 28:16 \fk A stone in the foundations: \ft Viz., Christ.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 28:16 \fk Let him not hasten, etc: \ft Let him expect his coming with patience.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 17 And I will establish judgment in weights, and justice in measures. And a hailstorm will overturn hope in what is false; and waters will inundate its protection.
\v 18 And your deal with death will be abolished, and your pact with Hell will not stand. When the inundating scourge passes through, you will be trampled down by it.
\v 19 Whenever it passes through, it will take you away. For, at first light of morning, it will pass through, in the day and in the night, and vexation alone will make you understand what you hear.
\v 20 For the bed has been narrowed, so much so that one alone would fall out, and the short blanket is not able to cover two.\f + \fr 28:20 \fk The bed is straitened, etc: \ft It is too narrow to hold two: God will have the bed of our heart all to himself.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 21 For the Lord will stand, just as at the mountain of divisions. He will be angry, just as in the valley which is in Gibeon, so that he may accomplish his work, his strange work, so that he may complete his work, his work which is foreign even to him.\f + \fr 28:21 \fk As in the mountain, etc: \ft As the Lord fought against the Philistines in Baal Pharasim, 2 Kings 5., and against the Chanaanites, in the valley of Gabaon, Jos. 10.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 22 And now, do not be willing to mock, lest your chains be tightened. For I have heard, from the Lord, the God of hosts, about the consummation and the abridgement concerning the entire earth.\f + \fr 28:22 \ft The consummation is the end of the reign of sin on earth, at the time of the return of Christ. This consummation occurs at the end of the tribulation, which is abbreviated lest no one survive.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 23 ¶ Pay close attention, and listen to my voice! Attend and hear my eloquence!
\v 24 Would the plowman, after plowing all day so that he may sow, instead cut open and hoe his soil?
\v 25 Will he not, when he has made the surface level, sow coriander, and scatter cumin, and plant wheat in rows, and barley, and millet, and vetch in their places?
\v 26 For he will be instructed in judgment; his God will teach him.
\v 27 For coriander cannot be threshed with a saw, and a cartwheel cannot revolve over cumin. Instead, coriander is shaken out with a stick, and cumin with a staff.
\v 28 But grain for bread must be crushed. Truly, the thresher cannot thresh it unceasingly, and the cartwheel can neither disrupt it, nor break it with its surface.
\v 29 And this has gone forth from the Lord, the God of hosts, so that he may accomplish his miraculous plan and magnify justice.\f + \fr 28:29 \fk This also, etc: \ft Such also is the proceeding of the Lord with his land, and the divers seeds he throws therein.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 2 And I will surround Ariel with siege works, and it will be in sorrow and mourning, and it will be like Ariel to me.
\v 3 And I will surround you like a sphere all around you, and I will raise up a rampart against you, and I will set up fortifications to blockade you.
\v 4 You will be brought low. You will speak from the ground, and your eloquence will be heard from the dirt. And, from the ground, your voice will be like that of the python, and your eloquence will mumble from the dirt.
\v 5 And the multitude of those who fan you will be like fine dust. And the multitude of those who have prevailed against you will be like embers fading away.
\v 6 And this will happen suddenly and swiftly. It will be visited from the Lord of hosts with thunder and earthquakes, and with the great noise of a whirlwind and a storm, and with a flame of devouring fire.
\v 7 And the multitude of all the nations that have struggled against Ariel will be like the dream of a vision by night, along with all who have battled, and besieged, and prevailed against it.
\v 8 ¶ And it will be like one who is hungry and dreams of eating, but, when he has been awakened, his soul is empty. And it will be like one who is thirsty and dreams of drinking, but, after he has been awakened, he still languishes in thirst, and his soul is empty. So shall the multitude of all the nations be, who have struggled against Mount Zion.
\v 9 ¶ Be stupefied and in wonder! Shake and quiver! Be inebriated, but not from wine! Stagger, but not from drunkenness!
\v 10 For the Lord has mixed for you a spirit of deep sleep. He will close your eyes. He will cover your prophets and leaders, who see visions.
\v 11 And the vision of all will be to you like the words of a sealed book, which, when they have given it to someone who knows how to read, they will say, “Read this,” but he will respond, “I cannot; for it has been sealed.”
\v 12 But if the book is given to someone who does not know how to read, and it is said to him, “Read,” then he will respond, “I do not know how to read.”
\v 13 ¶ And the Lord said: Since this people have drawn near to me only with their mouth, and their lips glorify me while their heart is far from me, and their fear of me is based on the commandments and doctrines of men,
\v 14 for this reason, behold, I will proceed to accomplish a wonder for this people, a great and mystifying miracle. For wisdom will perish from their wise, and the understanding of their prudent will be concealed.
\v 15 Woe to you who use the depths of the heart, so that you may hide your intentions from the Lord. Their works are done in darkness, and so they say: “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?”
\v 16 This intention of yours is perverse. It is as if the clay were to plan against the potter, or as if the work were to say to its maker: “You did not make me.” Or it is as if what has been formed were to say to the one who formed it, “You do not understand.”
\v 17 ¶ In not more than a little while and a brief time, Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and a fruitful field will be considered to be a forest.\f + \fr 29:17 \fk Charmel: \ft This word signifies a fruitful field.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 18 And in that day, the deaf will hear the words of a book, and out of darkness and obscurity the eyes of the blind will see.
\v 19 And the meek will increase their rejoicing in the Lord, and the poor among men will exult in the Holy One of Israel.
\v 20 For the one who was prevailing has failed, the one who was mocking has been consumed, and all those who were standing guard over iniquity have been cut down.
\v 21 For they caused men to sin by a word, and they supplanted him who argued against them at the gates, and they turned away from justice in vain.
\v 22 ¶ Because of this, thus says the Lord, he who has redeemed Abraham, to the house of Jacob: From now on, Jacob will not be confounded; from now on his countenance will not blush with shame.
\v 23 Instead, when he sees his children, they will be the work of my hands in his midst, sanctifying my name, and they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and they will preach the God of Israel.
\v 24 And those who had gone astray in spirit will know understanding, and those who had murmured will learn the law.

\cl Isaiah 30
\cd The people are blamed for their confidence in Egypt. God’s mercies towards his church. The punishment of sinners.
\v 1 ¶ “Woe to the sons of apostasy!” says the Lord. For you would take advice, but not from me. And you would begin to weave, but not by my spirit. Thus do you add sin upon sin!
\v 2 You are walking so as to descend into Egypt, and you have not sought answers from my mouth, instead hoping for assistance from the strength of Pharaoh and placing trust in the shadow of Egypt.
\v 3 And so, the strength of Pharaoh will be your confusion, and trust in the shadow of Egypt will be your disgrace.
\v 4 For your leaders were at Tanis, and your messengers have traveled even as far as Hanes.
\v 5 They have all been confounded because of a people who were not able to offer profit to them, who were not of assistance, nor of other usefulness, except to offer confusion and reproach.
\v 6 The burden of the beasts in the south. In a land of tribulation and anguish, from which go forth the lioness and the lion, the viper and the flying king snake, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of beasts of burden, and their valuables upon the humps of camels, to a people who are not able to offer profit to them.
\v 7 For Egypt will offer assistance, but without purpose or success. Therefore, concerning this, I cried out: “It is only arrogance! Remain calm.”
\v 8 Now, therefore, enter and write for them upon a tablet, and note it diligently in a book, and this shall be a testimony in the last days, and even unto eternity.
\v 9 For they are a people who provoke to wrath, and they are lying sons, sons unwilling to listen to the law of God.
\v 10 They say to the seers, “Do not see,” and to those who behold: “Do not behold for us the things that are right. Speak to us of pleasing things. See errors for us.
\v 11 Take me from the way. Avert me from the path. Let the Holy One of Israel cease from before our face.”
\v 12 Because of this, thus says the Holy One of Israel: Since you have rejected this word, and you have hoped in calumny and rebellion, and since you have depended upon these things,
\v 13 for this reason, this iniquity will be to you like a breach that has fallen, and like a gap in a high wall. For its destruction will happen suddenly, when it is not expected.
\v 14 And it will be crushed, just as the earthen vessel of a potter is destroyed by a sharp blow. And not even a fragment of its earthenware will be found, which might carry a little fire from the hearth, or which might draw a little water from a hollow.
\v 15 For thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: If you return and are quiet, you shall be saved. Your strength will be found in silence and in hope. But you are not willing!
\v 16 And you have said: “Never! Instead, we will flee by horseback.” For this reason, you will be put to flight. And you have said, “We will climb upon swift ones.” For this reason, those who pursue you will be even swifter.
\v 17 A thousand men will flee in terror from the face of one, and you will flee in terror from the face of five, until you who have been left behind are like the mast of a ship at the top of a mountain, or like a sign on a hill.
\v 18 Therefore, the Lord waits, so that he may take pity on you. And therefore, he will be exalted for sparing you. For the Lord is the God of judgment. Blessed are all those who wait for him.
\v 19 For the people of Zion will live in Jerusalem. Bitterly, you will not weep. Mercifully, he will take pity on you. At the voice of your outcry, as soon as he hears, he will respond to you.\f + \fr 30:19 \ft The redundant use of ‘plorans … plorabis’ and ‘miserans miserebitur’ intensifies the meaning of the verb. The translation need not have the same redundancy, as long as the intensity of meaning is conveyed.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 20 And the Lord will give you thick bread and accessible water. And he will not cause your teacher to fly away from you anymore. And your eyes will behold your instructor.\f + \fr 30:20 \ft The phrase ‘panem arctum, et aquam brevem’ does not mean that the Lord will give too little bread and water. Note the context of the previous verse, where God says He will answer prayers promptly. So he would not next say that no one will have enough bread or water. The word ‘arctum’ means thick, and the idea of thick bread (a very full robust bread that is full of nutrition) fits the context of a time of God’s favor. The word ‘brevem’ does not mean too little water, but rather, readily available water, which can be obtained in a short time.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 21 And your ears will listen to the word of one admonishing you behind your back: “This is the way! Walk in it! And do not turn aside, neither to the right, nor to the left.”
\v 22 And you will defile the plates of your silver graven images and the vestment of your gold molten idols. And you will throw these things away like the uncleanness of a menstruating woman. You will say to it, “Go away!”
\v 23 And wherever you sow seed upon the earth, rain will be given to the seed. And bread from the grain of the earth will be very plentiful and full. In that day, the lamb will pasture in the spacious land of your possession.
\v 24 And your bulls, and the colts of the donkeys that work the ground, will eat a mix of grains like that winnowed on the threshing floor.
\v 25 And there will be, on every lofty mountain, and on every elevated hill, rivers of running water, in the day of the slaughter of many, when the tower will fall.
\v 26 And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, in the day when the Lord will bind the wound of his people, and when he will heal the stroke of their scourge.
\v 27 Behold, the name of the Lord arrives from far away. His fury is burning and heavy to bear. His lips have been filled with indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire.
\v 28 His Spirit is like a torrent, inundating, even as high as the middle of the neck, in order to reduce the nations to nothing, along with the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the people.
\v 29 There will be a song for you, as in the night of a sanctified solemnity, and a joy of heart, as when one travels with music to arrive at the mountain of the Lord, to the Strong One of Israel.
\v 30 And the Lord will cause the glory of his voice to be heard, and, with a threatening fury and a devouring flame of fire, he will reveal the terror of his arm. He will crush with the whirlwind and with hailstones.
\v 31 For at the voice of the Lord, Assur will dread being struck with the staff.
\v 32 And when the passage of the staff has been begun, the Lord will cause it to rest upon him, with timbrels and harps. And with special battles, he will fight against them.
\v 33 For a burning place, deep and wide, has been prepared from yesterday, prepared by the King. Its nourishment is fire and much wood.

\cd The folly of trusting to Egypt, and forgetting God. He will fight for his people against the Assyrians.
\v 1 ¶ Woe to those who descend into Egypt for assistance, hoping in horses, and putting their trust in four-horse chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are exceedingly strong. And they have not believed in the Holy One of Israel, and they have not sought the Lord.
\v 2 Therefore, being wise, he has permitted harm, and he has not removed his words, and he will rise up against the house of the wicked and against those who assist the workers of iniquity.
\v 3 Egypt is man, and not God. And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. And so, the Lord will reach down his hand, and the helper will fall, and the one who was being helped will fall, and they will all be consumed together.
\v 4 For the Lord says this to me: In the same way that a lion roars, and a young lion is over his prey, and though a multitude of shepherds may meet him, he will not dread their voice, nor be afraid of their number, so will the Lord of hosts descend in order to battle upon mount Zion and upon its hill.
\v 5 Like birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem, protecting and freeing, passing over and saving.
\v 6 Be converted to the same depth that you have drawn away, O sons of Israel.
\v 7 For in that day, a man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you unto sin.
\v 8 ¶ And Assur will fall by a sword not of man, and a sword not of man will devour him. And he will not flee from the face of the sword, and his young men will be subject to a penalty.\f + \fr 31:8 \ft The phrase ‘vectigales erunt’ usually refers to persons who are subject to the payment of a tribute, after they have been conquered. In this context, it refers to some penalty after having been defeated, perhaps not a monetary one.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 9 And his strength will pass away in terror, and his princes will flee in fear. The Lord has said it. His fire is in Zion, and his furnace is at Jerusalem.

\cl Isaiah 32
\cd The blessings of the reign of Christ. The desolation of the Jews, and prosperity of the church of Christ.
\v 1 ¶ Behold, the king will reign in justice, and the princes will rule in judgment.
\v 2 And a man will be like someone hidden from the wind, who conceals himself from a storm, or like rivers of waters in a time of thirst, or like the shadow of a rock that juts out in a desert land.
\v 3 The eyes of those who see will not be obscured, and the ears of those who hear will listen closely.
\v 4 And the heart of the foolish will understand knowledge, and the tongue of those with impaired speech will speak quickly and plainly.
\v 5 He who is foolish will no longer be called leader, nor will the deceitful be called greater.
\v 6 For a foolish man speaks foolishness and his heart works iniquity in order to accomplish deception. And he speaks to the Lord deceitfully, so as to empty the soul of the hungry and to take away drink from the thirsty.
\v 7 The tools of the deceitful are very wicked. For they have concocted plans to destroy the meek by lying words, though the poor speak judgment.
\v 8 Yet truly, the prince will plan things that are worthy of a prince, and he will stand above the rulers.
\v 9 You opulent women, rise up and listen to my voice! O confident daughters, play close attention to my eloquence!
\v 10 For after a year and some days, you who are confident will be disturbed. For the vintage has been completed; the gathering will no longer occur.
\v 11 Be stupefied, you opulent women! Be disturbed, O confident ones! Strip yourselves, and be confounded; gird yourselves at the waist.
\v 12 Mourn over your breasts, over the delightful country, over the fruitful vineyard.
\v 13 Thorn and brier will rise up, over the soil of my people. How much more over all the houses of gladness, over the city of exultation?
\v 14 For the house has been forsaken. The multitude of the city has been abandoned. A darkness and a covering have been placed over its dens, even unto eternity. It will be the gladness of wild donkeys and the pasture of flocks,
\v 15 until the Spirit is poured over us from on high. And the desert will be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered as a forest.
\v 16 ¶ And judgment will live in solitude, and justice will be seated in a fruitful place.

\v 1 ¶ Woe to you who plunder! Will you yourselves not also be plundered? And woe to you who despise! Will you yourselves not also be despised? When you will have completed your plundering, you will be plundered. When, out of fatigue, you will have ceased acting with contempt, you will be treated with contempt.\f + \fr 33:1 \fk That spoilest, etc: \ft This is particularly directed to Sennacherib.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 2 O Lord, take pity on us. For we have waited for you. Be our arm in the morning and our salvation in the time of tribulation.
\v 3 From the voice of the Angel, the people fled. And from your exultation, the nations were scattered.
\v 4 And your spoils will be gathered together, just as the locusts are collected when the ditches have become filled with them.
\v 5 The Lord has been magnified, because he has lived on high. He has filled Zion with judgment and justice.
\v 6 And there will be faith in your times: the riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge. For the fear of the Lord is his treasure.
\v 7 Behold, outside, those who see will cry out. The Angels of peace will weep bitterly.\f + \fr 33:7 \fk The angels of peace: \ft The messengers or deputies sent to negotiate a peace.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 8 The roads have become desolate. Travelers have ceased along the paths. The covenant has been nullified. He has tossed aside cities. He has disregarded men.
\v 9 The earth has mourned and languished. Lebanon has been confounded and desecrated. And Sharon has become like a desert. And Bashan and Carmel have been struck together.
\v 10 ¶ “Now, I will rise up!” says the Lord. “Now I will be exalted! Now I will lift myself up!”
\v 11 You will conceive heat. You will give birth to stubble. Your own spirit will devour you like fire.
\v 12 And the people will be like the ashes from a fire. They will be consumed by fire like a bundle of thorns.
\v 13 ¶ “You who are far away, listen to what I have done! And you who are near, acknowledge my strength!”
\v 14 The sinners in Zion are terrified; trembling has taken hold of the hypocrites. Who among you is able to live with a devouring fire? Who among you will live with an everlasting flame?
\v 15 The one who walks in justice and speaks the truth, who casts out avarice with oppression and shakes all bribes from his hands, who blocks his ears so that he may not listen to blood, and closes his eyes so that he may not see evil.
\v 16 Such a one will live on high; the fortification of rocks will be his lofty place. Bread has been given to him; his waters are reliable.
\v 17 ¶ His eyes will see the king in his elegance; they will discern the land from far away.
\v 18 Your heart will meditate on fear. Where are the learned? Where are those who ponder the words of the law? Where are the teachers of little ones?
\v 19 You will not look upon a shameless people, a people of exalted words. For you are not able to understand the dissertation of a tongue in which there is no wisdom.
\v 20 Look with favor upon Zion, the city of our solemnity. Your eyes will behold Jerusalem: an opulent habitation, a tabernacle that can never be taken away. Its stakes will not be taken away forever, nor will any of its cords be broken.\f + \fr 33:20 \ft The tabernacle of Jerusalem is being described under the figure of a tent. Its stakes are its tent pegs, and its cords connect the tent pegs to the tent, anchoring the tent itself.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 21 For only in that place has our Lord been magnified. It is a place of rivers, very broad and open. No ship with oars will cross through it, nor will the great Greek ship pass through it.\f + \fr 33:21 \fk Of rivers: \ft He speaks of the rivers of endless joys that flow from the throne of God to water the heavenly Jerusalem, where no enemy’s ship can come, etc.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 22 For the Lord is our judge. The Lord is our lawgiver. The Lord is our king. He himself will save us.
\v 23 Your ropes have become loose, and they will not prevail. Your mast will be such that you will not be able to unfurl a flag. Then the spoils of much plunder will be divided.

\v 2 For the indignation of the Lord is over all the nations, and his fury is over all their armies. He has put them to death, and he has given them over to slaughter.
\v 3 Their slain will be cast out, and from their carcasses a foul odor will rise up. The mountains will languish because of their blood.
\v 4 And the entire army of the heavens will languish, and the heavens will be folded like a book. And their entire army will fall away, as a leaf falls from the vine or from the fig tree.\f + \fr 34:4 \fk And all the host of the heavens: \ft That is, the sun, moon, and stars.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 6 The sword of the Lord has been filled with blood. It has been thickened by the blood of lambs and he-goats, by the innermost blood of rams. For the victim of the Lord is in Bozrah, and a great slaughter is in the land of Edom.
\v 7 And the single-horned beasts will descend with them, and the bulls along with the mighty. Their land will be inebriated by blood, and their ground by the fat of their lazy ones.\f + \fr 34:7 \fk The unicorns: \ft That is, the great and mighty.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 11 ¶ The pelican and the hedgehog will possess it. And the ibis and the raven will live in it. And a measuring line will be extended over it, so that it may be reduced to nothing, and a plumb line, unto desolation.
\v 12 Its nobles will not be in that place. Instead, they will call upon the king, and all its leaders will be as nothing.
\v 13 And thorns and nettles will rise up in its houses, and the thistle in its fortified places. And it will be the lair of serpents and the pasture of ostriches.
\v 14 And demons and monsters will meet, and the hairy ones will cry out to one another. There, the ogress has lain down and found rest for herself.\f + \fr 34:14 \ft Mythological elements such as these, in Sacred Scripture, are used poetically, not literally.\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 3 ¶ Strengthen the lax hands, and confirm the weak knees!
\v 4 Say to the fainthearted: “Take courage and fear not! Behold, your God will bring the vindication of retribution. God himself will arrive to save you.”

\cd Sennacherib invades Juda: his blasphemies.
\v 1 ¶ And it happened that, in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, went up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he seized them.
\v 2 And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabshakeh from Lachish into Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah, with a great force, and he stood near the aqueduct of the upper pool, at the road to the fuller’s field.
\v 3 And those who went to him were Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna, the scribe, and Joah, son of Asaph, the historian.
\v 4 ¶ And Rabshakeh said to them: “Tell Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this faith in which you believe?
\v 5 And by what counsel or strength would you prepare to rebel? In whom do you have faith, so much so that you would withdraw from me?
\v 6 Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, in that broken staff of a reed. But if a man were to lean against it, it would enter his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.
\v 7 But if you answer me by saying: ‘We trust in the Lord our God.’ Is it not his high places and altars that Hezekiah has taken away? And he has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar.’
\v 8 And now, hand yourselves over to my lord, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, and you will not be able to find riders for them on your own.
\v 9 So how will you withstand the face of the ruler of even one place, of even the least of my lord’s subordinates? But if you trust in Egypt, in four-horse chariots and in horsemen:
\v 10 do I intend to go up against this land to destroy it without the Lord? But the Lord said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’ ”
\v 11 ¶ And Eliakim, and Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh: “Speak to your servants in the Syrian language. For we understand it. Do not speak to us in the Jewish language, in the hearing of the people, who are upon the wall.”
\v 12 ¶ And Rabshakeh said to them: “Has my lord sent me to your lord and to you in order to speak all these words, and not even more so to the men who are sitting on the wall, so that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”
\v 13 Then Rabshakeh stood up, and he cried out with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and he said: “Listen to the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians.
\v 14 Thus says the king: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. For he will not be able to rescue you.
\v 15 And do not let Hezekiah cause you to trust in the Lord, saying: ‘The Lord will rescue and free us. This city will not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.’
\v 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah. For the king of the Assyrians says this: Act with me to your own benefit, and come out to me. And let each one eat from his own vine, and each one from his own fig tree. And let each one drink water from his own well,
\v 17 until I arrive and take you away to a land which is like your own: a land of grain and of wine, a land of bread and of vineyards.
\v 18 But you should not let Hezekiah disturb you, saying, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’ Have any of the gods of each of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
\v 19 Where is the god of Hamath and of Arpad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim? Have they freed Samaria from my hand?
\v 20 Who is there, among all the gods of these lands, who has rescued his land from my hand, so that the Lord would rescue Jerusalem from my hand?”
\v 21 And they remained silent and did not answer a word to him. For the king had commanded them, saying, “You shall not respond to him.”
\v 22 ¶ And Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna, the scribe, and Joah, son of Asaph, the historian, entered to Hezekiah with their garments rent, and they reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
\c 37
\cl Isaiah 37
\cd Ezechias, his mourning and prayer. God’s promise of protection. The Assyrian army is destroyed. Sennacherib is slain.
\v 1 ¶ And it happened that, when king Hezekiah had heard this, he rent his garments, and he wrapped himself in sackcloth, and he entered the house of the Lord.
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna, the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the prophet.
\v 3 And they said to him: “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy. For the sons have arrived at the time for birth, but there is not enough strength to bring them forth.
\v 4 Perhaps, somehow, the Lord your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of the Assyrians, his lord, has sent to blaspheme the living God, and will rebuke the words that the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayers on behalf of the remnant which has been left behind.”
\v 5 And so the servants of king Hezekiah went to Isaiah.
\v 6 ¶ And Isaiah said to them: “You shall say this to your lord: Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid to face the words that you have heard, by which the servants of the king of the Assyrians blasphemed me.
\v 7 Behold, I will send a spirit to him, and he will hear a message, and he will return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword, in his own land.”
\v 8 ¶ Then Rabshakeh returned, and he found the king of the Assyrians fighting against Libnah. For he had heard that he had set out from Lachish.
\v 9 And he heard from Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia: “He has gone forth so that he may fight against you.” And when he had heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:
\v 10 “You shall say this to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, saying: Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying: ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.’
\v 11 Behold, you have heard about all that the kings of the Assyrians have done to all the lands that they have conquered, and so, how can you be delivered?
\v 12 Have the gods of the nations rescued those whom my fathers have conquered: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were at Telassar?
\v 13 Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad, or the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena and Ivvah?”
\v 14 ¶ And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and he read it, and he went up to the house of the Lord, and Hezekiah spread it out in the sight of the Lord.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying:
\v 16 “O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel who sits upon the Cherubim: you alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
\v 17 O Lord, incline your ear and listen. O Lord, open your eyes and see. And hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to blaspheme the living God.
\v 18 For truly, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste to countries and territories.
\v 19 And they have cast their gods into the fire. For these were not gods, but the works of men’s hands, of wood and of stone. And they broke them into pieces.
\v 20 And now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand. And let all the kingdoms of the earth acknowledge that you alone are Lord.”
\v 21 ¶ And Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because of what you have prayed to me about Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians,
\v 22 this is the word that the Lord has spoken over him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and mocked you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
\v 23 Whom have you insulted? And whom have you blasphemed? And against whom have you lifted up your voice and raised up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!
\v 24 By the hand of your servants, you have reproached the Lord. And you have said: ‘With a multitude of my four-horse chariots, I have ascended the heights of the mountains adjoining Lebanon. And I will cut down its lofty cedars and its choice pine trees. And I will reach the top of its summit, to the forest of its Carmel.\f + \fr 37:24 \fk Carmel: \ft See these figurative expressions explained in the annotations on the nineteenth chapter of the fourth book of Kings.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 25 I dug deep, and I drank water, and I dried up all the river banks with the sole of my foot.’
\v 26 Have you not heard what I have done to it in past times? In ancient times, I formed it. And now I have brought it forth. And it has been made so that the hills and the fortified cities would fight together, unto its destruction.
\v 27 Their inhabitants had unsteady hands. They trembled and were confused. They became like the plants of the field, and the grass of the pastures, and like the weeds on the rooftops, which wither before they are mature.
\v 28 I know your habitation, and your arrival, and your departure, and your madness against me.
\v 29 When you became angry against me, your arrogance rose up to my ears. Therefore, I will place a ring in your nose, and a bit between your lips. And I will turn you back on the road by which you arrived.
\v 30 But this shall be a sign for you: Eat, in this year, whatever springs up on its own. And in the second year, eat fruits. But in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
\v 31 And what will be saved from the house of Judah, and what is left behind, will form deep roots, and will bear high fruits.
\v 32 For from Jerusalem, a remnant shall go forth, and salvation from mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this.
\v 33 For this reason, thus says the Lord about the king of the Assyrians: He will not enter this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor overtake it with a shield, nor dig a rampart all around it.
\v 34 He will return on the road by which he arrived. And into this city, he will not enter, says the Lord.
\v 35 And I will protect this city, so that I may save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David, my servant.”
\v 36 ¶ Then the Angel of the Lord went forth and struck down, in the camp of the Assyrians, one hundred eighty-five thousand. And they arose in the morning, and behold, all these were dead bodies.
\v 37 ¶ And Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, departed and went away. And he returned and lived at Nineveh.
\v 38 And it happened that, as he was adoring his god in the temple of Nisroch, his sons, Adramelech and Sharezer, struck him with the sword. And they fled into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place.

\v 2 And Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and he prayed to the Lord.
\v 3 And he said: “I beg you, Lord, I beseech you, to remember how I walked before you in truth and with a whole heart, and that I have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.
\v 4 ¶ And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying:
\v 5 “Go and say to Hezekiah: Thus says the Lord, the God of David, your father: I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your days.

\v 12 My longevity has been taken away; it has been folded up and taken from me, like the tent of a shepherd. My life has been cut off, as if by a weaver. While I was still beginning, he cut me off. From morning until evening, you have marked out my limits.
\v 13 I hoped, even until morning. Like a lion, so has he crushed all my bones. From morning until evening, you have marked my limits.
\v 14 I will cry out, like a young swallow. I will meditate, like a dove. My eyes have been weakened by gazing upward. O Lord, I suffer violence! Answer in my favor.
\v 15 What can I say, or what would he answer me, since he himself has done this? I will acknowledge to you all my years, in the bitterness of my soul.
\v 16 O Lord, if such is life, and if the life of my spirit is of such a kind, may you correct me and may you cause me to live.
\v 17 Behold, in peace my bitterness is most bitter. But you have rescued my soul, so that it would not perish. You have cast all my sins behind your back.
\v 18 For Hell will not confess to you, and death will not praise you. Those who descend into the pit will not hope for your truth.

\v 2 And Hezekiah rejoiced over them, and he showed them the storehouses of his aromatic spices, and of the silver and gold, and of the perfumes and precious ointments, and all the repositories for his belongings, and all the things that were found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
\v 3 Then Isaiah the prophet entered before king Hezekiah, and he said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They came to me from a far away land, from Babylon.”
\v 4 And he said, “What did they see in your house?” And Hezekiah said: “They have seen all the things that are in my house. There was nothing that I did not show them among my treasures.”
\v 5 And Isaiah said to Hezekiah: “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:

\v 26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these things. He leads forth their army by number, and he calls them all by name. Because of the fullness of his strength and robustness and virtue, not one of them was left behind.
\v 27 ¶ Why do you say this, O Jacob, and why do you speak this way, O Israel? “My way has been hidden from the Lord, and my judgment escaped notice by my God.”
\v 28 Do you not know, or have you not heard? The Lord is the eternal God, who has created the limits of the earth. He does not diminish, and he does not struggle. Neither is his wisdom searchable.
\v 29 It is he who gives strength to the weary, and it is he who increases fortitude and strength in those who are failing.
\v 30 Servants will struggle and fail, and young men will fall into infirmity.
\v 31 But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will take up wings like eagles. They will run and not struggle. They will walk and not tire.

\cl Isaiah 41
\cd The reign of the just one: the vanity of idols.
\v 1 ¶ Let the islands be silent before me, and let the nations take new strength. Let them draw near, and then speak. Let us apply for judgment together.
\v 2 Who has raised up a just man from the east, and has called him to follow him? He will place the nations under his gaze, and he will rule over kings. He will cause them to be like dust before his sword, like chaff driven by the wind before his bow.\f + \fr 41:2 \ft In my interpretation, this passage refers to the great Catholic monarch, to his war, and to his subsequent reign in peace.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 3 He will pursue them. He will pass by in peace. No trace will appear after his feet.
\v 4 Who has worked and accomplished these things, calling to the generations from the beginning? “It is I, the Lord! I am the first and the last.”
\v 5 The islands saw it and were afraid. The ends of the earth were stupefied. They drew near and arrived.
\v 6 Each one will help his neighbor and will say to his brother, “Be strengthened.”
\v 7 The coppersmith striking with the mallet encouraged him who was forging at that time, saying, “It is ready for soldering.” And he strengthened it with nails, so that it would not be moved.
\v 8 But you, O Israel, are my servant, O Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of my friend Abraham.
\v 9 For his sake, I have taken you from the ends of the earth, and I have called you from its distant places. And I said to you: “You are my servant. I have chosen you, and I have not cast you aside.”
\v 10 Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not turn away, for I am your God. I have strengthened you, and I have assisted you, and the right hand of my just one has upheld you.
\v 11 Behold, all who fight against you shall be confounded and ashamed. They will be as if they did not exist, and the men who contradict you will perish.
\v 12 You will seek them, and you will not find them. The men who rebel against you will be as if they did not exist. And the men who make war against you will be like something that has been consumed.
\v 13 For I am the Lord your God. I take you by your hand, and I say to you: Do not be afraid. I have helped you.
\v 14 Fear not, O worm of Jacob, you who are dead within Israel. I have helped you, says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
\v 15 I have established you like a new threshing cart, having serrated blades. You will thresh the mountains and crush them. And you will turn the hills into chaff.
\v 16 You will winnow them, and the wind will blow them away, and the whirlwind will scatter them. And you shall exult in the Lord; you shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
\v 17 The indigent and the poor are seeking water, but there is none. Their tongue has been dried up by thirst. I, the Lord, will heed them. I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.
\v 18 I will open rivers in the high hills, and fountains in the midst of the plains. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the impassable land into streams of water.
\v 19 I will plant the cedar in a deserted place, with the thorn, and the myrtle, and the olive tree. In the desert, I will plant the pine, and the elm, and the box tree together,\f + \fr 41:19 \fk The thorn: \ft In Hebrew, the shitta, or setim, a tree resembling the white thorn.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 20 so that they may see and know, acknowledge and understand, together, that the hand of the Lord has accomplished this, and that the Holy One of Israel has created it.
\v 21 ¶ Bring your case forward, says the Lord. Bring it here, if you have anything to allege, says the King of Jacob.
\v 22 Let them approach and announce to us the things that will occur. Announce to us the things that were before. And we will apply our heart to them, and we will know their end. And so, reveal to us the things that will occur.
\v 23 Announce the things that will occur in the future, and we will know that you are gods. Likewise, accomplish good or evil, if you are able, and let us speak of it and see it together.
\v 24 Behold, you exist out of nothing, and your work is from what does not exist; he who has chosen you is an abomination.
\v 25 ¶ I have raised up one from the north, and he will arrive from the rising of the sun. He will call upon my name, and he will reduce magistrates to mud, like a potter working with clay.
\v 26 Who has announced this from its rising, so that we may know it, or from its beginning, so that we may say, “You are just.” There is no one who either announces, or predicts, or hears your words.
\v 27 The first one will say to Zion: “Behold, they are here,” and to Jerusalem, “I will present an evangelist.”
\v 28 And I saw, and there was no one among any of them to consult, or who, when I asked, could answer a word.
\v 29 Behold, they are all unjust, and their works are empty. Their idols are wind and emptiness.

\v 2 He will not cry out, and he will not show favoritism to anyone; neither will his voice be heard abroad.
\v 3 The bruised reed he will not break, and the smoldering wick he will not extinguish. He will lead forth judgment unto truth.
\v 4 He will not be saddened or troubled, until he establishes judgment on earth. And the islands will await his law.
\v 5 ¶ Thus says the Lord God, who created the heavens and expanded it, who formed the earth and all that springs from it, who gives breath to the people in it, and spirit to those walking on it.
\v 6 I, the Lord, have called you in justice, and I have taken your hand and preserved you. And I have presented you as a covenant of the people, as a light to the Gentiles,
\v 7 so that you may open the eyes of the blind, and lead out the prisoner from confinement and those sitting in darkness from the house of incarceration.
\v 8 I am the Lord; this is my name. I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven things.
\v 9 The things that were first, behold, they have arrived. And I also announce what is new. Before these things arise, I will cause you to hear about them.
\v 10 Sing to the Lord a new canticle, sing his praise from the ends of the earth, you who descend into the sea and all its fullness, the islands and their inhabitants.
\v 11 Let the desert and its cities be lifted up. Kedar will dwell in houses. O inhabitants of the rock, give praise! They will cry out from the top of the mountains.\f + \fr 42:11 \fk Petra: \ft A city that gives name to Arabia Petraea.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 12 They will give glory to the Lord, and they will announce his praise to the islands.
\v 13 The Lord will go forth like a strong man; like a man of battle, he will stir up zeal. He will shout and cry out. He will prevail against his enemies.
\v 14 I have always been quiet; I have been silent; I have been patient. I will speak like a woman giving birth. I will destroy and consume, all at once.
\v 15 I will desolate the mountains and the hills, and I will wither all their grass. And I will turn rivers into islands, and I will dry up the pools of water.
\v 16 And I will lead the blind along a way which they do not know. And I will cause them to walk along paths with which they were unfamiliar. I will turn darkness into light before them, and crooked into straight. These things I have done for them. For I have not abandoned them.
\v 17 ¶ They have been converted again. Let those who trust in graven idols be greatly confounded, for they say to a molten thing, “You are our god.”
\v 18 You who are deaf, hear! You who are blind, turn your gaze and see!
\v 19 Who is blind, except my servant? Who is deaf, except the one to whom I have sent my messengers? Who is blind, except the one who has been sold? And who is blind, except the servant of the Lord?
\v 20 You who see many things, will you not keep them? You who have open ears, will you not listen?
\v 21 And the Lord was willing to sanctify him, and to magnify the law, and to exalt him.
\v 22 But this same people has robbed and laid waste. All their youth are a snare, and they have been hidden in houses of confinement. They have become victims; there is no one who may rescue them. They have been plundered; there is no one who may say, “Restore.”
\v 23 Who is there among you who will hear this, who will listen closely and heed this in the future?
\v 24 Who has handed over Jacob into plunder, and Israel into devastation? Is it not the Lord himself, against whom we have sinned? And they were not willing to walk in his ways, and they have not listened to his law.
\v 25 And so, he poured out over him the indignation of his fury and a strong battle. And he burned him all around, and he did not realize it. And he set him on fire, and he did not understand it.

\v 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and the rivers will not cover you. When you walk through fire, you will not be burned, and the flames will not scorch you.
\v 3 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I have presented Egypt as your atonement, Ethiopia and Seba on your behalf.
\v 4 Since then, you have become honorable in my eyes, and glorious. I have loved you, and I will present men on behalf of you, and people on behalf of your life.
\v 5 Fear not, for I am with you. I will lead your offspring from the East, and I will gather you from the West.
\v 6 I will say to the North, “Release him,” and to the South, “Do not turn him away.” Bring my sons from far away, and my daughters from the ends of the earth.

\v 8 ¶ Lead forth the people who are blind and have eyes, who are deaf and have ears.
\v 9 All the nations have been assembled together, and the tribes have been collected. Who among you will announce this, and who will cause us to listen to the things that are first? Let them present their witnesses. Let them act justly, and listen, and say: “It is true.”
\v 10 You are my witnesses, says the Lord, and you are my servant, whom I have chosen, so that you may know, and may believe in me, and so that you may understand that I am the same.

\v 13 And from the beginning, I am the same. And there is no one who can rescue from my hand. I act, and who can turn it aside?
\v 14 ¶ Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake, I sent to Babylon, and tore down all their bars, with the Chaldeans who glory in their ships.

\v 16 Thus says the Lord, who gave you a way through the sea and a path through the torrent of waters,
\v 17 who led out the chariot and the horse, the column of robust troops. They went to sleep together, and they will not arise. They have been crushed like flax, and they have been extinguished.
\v 18 ¶ You need not call to mind the past, nor consider the things of antiquity.
\v 19 Behold, I am accomplishing new things. And presently, they will spring forth. With certainty, you will know them. I will make a way in the desert, and rivers in an impassible place.
\v 20 The wild beasts of the field will glorify me, with the serpents and the ostriches. For I have brought waters to the desert, rivers to inaccessible places, in order to give drink to my people, to my elect.
\v 21 This is the people whom I have formed for myself. They will speak my praise.
\v 22 ¶ But you have not called upon me, O Jacob, nor have you struggled for me, O Israel.
\v 23 You have not offered me the ram of your holocaust, and you have not glorified me with your victims. I have not burdened you with oblations, nor have I wearied you with incense.
\v 24 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, and you have not inebriated me with the fat of your victims. Yet truly, you have burdened me with your sins; you have wearied me with your iniquities.
\v 25 I am. I am the very One who wipes away your iniquities for my own sake. And I will not remember your sins.
\v 26 Call me to mind, and let us go to judgment together. If you have anything to justify yourself, explain it.

\v 7 Who is like me? Let him call out and announce it. And let him explain to me the order of things, since it is I who appointed the ancient people. The things of the near and the distant future, let him announce them.
\v 8 Do not be afraid, and do not be disturbed. From the time when I caused you to listen, I also announced it. You are my witnesses. Is there another God beside me, also a Maker, whom I have not known?
\v 9 All of those who create idols are nothing, and their most beloved things will not benefit them. These are their witnesses, for they do not see, and they do not understand, so that they might be confounded.
\v 10 Who has formed a god or cast a molten image, which is useful for nothing?
\v 11 Behold, all those who partake in this will be confounded. For these makers are men. They will all assemble together. They will stand and be terrified. And they will be confounded together.
\v 12 The maker of iron has wrought with his file. With coals and hammers, he has formed it, and he has wrought with the strength of his arm. He will hunger and grow faint. He will not drink water, and he will become weary.
\v 13 The maker of wood has extended his ruler. He has formed it with a plane. He has made it with corners, and he has smoothed its curves. And he has made the image of a man, a seemingly beautiful man, dwelling in a house.
\v 14 He has cut down cedars; he has taken the evergreen oak, and the oak that stood among the trees of the forest. He has planted the pine tree, which the rain has nourished.
\v 15 And it is used by men for fuel. He took from it and warmed himself. And he set it on fire and baked bread. But from the remainder, he made a god, and he adored it. He made an idol, and he bowed down before it.
\v 16 Part of it, he burned with fire, and with part of it, he cooked meat; he boiled food and was filled. And he was warmed, and so he said: “Ah, I am warm. I have gazed at the fire.”
\v 17 But from its remainder, he made a god and a graven image for himself. He bowed down before it, and he adored it, and he prayed to it, saying: “Free me! For you are my god.”
\v 18 They have neither known nor understood. For their eyes are obscured, lest they see with their eyes and understand with their heart.
\v 19 They do not consider in their mind, nor do they know, nor do they think to say: “I have burned part of it in the fire, and I have baked bread upon its coals. I have cooked flesh and I have eaten. And from its remainder, should I make an idol? Should I fall prostrate before the trunk of a tree?”
\v 20 Part of it is ashes. His foolish heart adores it. And he will not liberate his soul, and he will not say, “Perhaps there is a lie in my right hand.”
\v 21 ¶ Remember these things, O Jacob, O Israel. For you are my servant. I have formed you. You are my servant, Israel. Do not forget me.
\v 22 I have wiped away your iniquities like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to me, because I have redeemed you.
\v 23 Give praise, O heavens! For the Lord has shown mercy. Shout with joy, O ends of the earth! Let the mountains resound with praise, with the forest and all its trees. For the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and Israel will be glorified.
\v 24 Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, and your Maker from the womb: I am the Lord, who makes all things, who alone extends the heavens, who makes the earth firm. And there is no one with me.
\v 25 I make the signs of the diviners useless, and I turn the seers to madness. I turn the wise backwards, and make their knowledge into foolishness.
\v 26 I lift up the word of my servant, and I fulfill the counsel of my messengers. I say to Jerusalem, “You shall be inhabited,” and to the cities of Judah, “You shall be rebuilt,” and I will lift up its deserts.
\v 27 I say to the depths, “Be desolate,” and, “I will dry up your rivers.”

\v 11 Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, his Maker: Would you question me about the future, concerning my sons, and command me concerning the work of my hands?
\v 12 I made the earth, and I created man upon it. My hand stretched out the heavens, and I have commanded all their hosts.
\v 13 I have raised him up unto justice, and I will direct all his ways. He himself will build my city and release my captives, but not for ransom or gifts, says the Lord, the God of hosts.
\v 14 Thus says the Lord: The labor of Egypt, and the business dealings of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, will pass to you and will be yours. They will walk behind you.

\v 19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I have not said to the offspring of Jacob, “Seek me in vain.” I am the Lord, who speaks justice, who announces what is right.
\v 20 ¶ Assemble yourselves, and approach, and draw near together, you who have been saved among the Gentiles. They lack knowledge, who lift up the wood of their sculpture, and who petition a god unable to save.
\v 21 Announce it, and approach, and consult together. Who has caused this to be heard from the beginning, and who has foretold it from that time? Is it not I, the Lord? And is there some other god beside me? I am a just God who saves, and there is no one except me.
\v 22 All ends of the earth, be converted to me, and you will be saved. For I am God, and there is no other.

\v 8 And now, hear these things, you who are delicate and have confidence, who say in your heart: “I am, and there is no one greater than me. I will not sit as a widow, and I will not know barrenness.”

\v 6 See all the things that you have heard. But were you the ones who announced them? From that time, I caused you to hear about new things, and you do not know how these were preserved.
\v 7 They are created now, and not in that time. And even before today, you did not hear of them; otherwise, you might say, “Behold, I knew them.”
\v 8 You have neither heard, nor known, nor were your ears open in that time. For I knew that you would transgress greatly, and so I called you a transgressor from the womb.
\v 9 ¶ For the sake of my name, I will take the face of my fury far away. And for the sake of my praise, I will bridle you, lest you perish.
\v 10 Behold, I have refined you, but not like silver. I have chosen you for the furnace of poverty.
\v 11 For my sake, for my own sake, I will do it, so that I may not be blasphemed. For I will not give my glory to another.
\v 12 ¶ Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call. I am the same, I am the first, and I am the last.
\v 13 Also, my hand has founded the earth, and my right hand has measured the heavens. I will call them, and they will stand together.
\v 14 Gather together, all of you, and listen. Who among them has announced these things? The Lord has loved him; he will do his will with Babylon, and his arm is upon the Chaldeans.
\v 15 I am, I have spoken, and I have called him. I have led him forward, and his way has been straight.
\v 16 Draw near to me, and listen to this. From the beginning, I have not spoken in secret. From the time before it happened, I was there. And now, the Lord God has sent me, and his Spirit.
\v 17 Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord, your God, who teaches you beneficial things, who guides you in the way that you walk.
\v 18 If only you had paid attention to my commandments! Your peace would have been like a river, and your justice would have been like the waves of the sea,
\v 19 and your offspring would have been like the sand, and the stock from your loins would have been like its stones. His name would not have passed away, nor would it have been worn away before my face.
\v 20 ¶ Depart from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Announce it with a voice of exultation. Cause it to be heard, and carry it even to the ends of the earth. Say: “The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.”
\v 21 They did not thirst in the desert, when he led them out. He produced water from the rock for them. For he split the rock, and the waters flowed out.
\v 22 “There is no peace for the impious,” says the Lord.

\cl Isaiah 49
\cd Christ shall bring the Gentiles to salvation. God’s love to his church is perpetual.
\v 1 ¶ Pay attention, you islands, and listen closely, you far away peoples. The Lord has called me from the womb; from the womb of my mother, he has been mindful of my name.
\v 2 And he has appointed my mouth as a sharp sword. In the shadow of his hand, he has protected me. And he has appointed me as an elect arrow. In his quiver, he has hidden me.
\v 3 And he has said to me: “You are my servant, Israel. For in you, I will glory.”
\v 4 And I said: “I have labored toward emptiness. I have consumed my strength without purpose and in vain. Therefore, my judgment is with the Lord, and my work is with my God.”
\v 5 ¶ And now, says the Lord, who formed me from the womb as his servant, so that I may bring back Jacob to him, for Israel will not be gathered together, but I have been glorified in the eyes of the Lord and my God has become my strength,
\v 6 and so he has said: “It is a small thing that you should be my servant so as to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and so as to convert the dregs of Israel. Behold, I have offered you as a light for the Gentiles, so that you may be my salvation, even to the furthest regions of the earth.”
\v 7 Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to a contemptible soul, to an abominable nation, to the servant of lords: The kings will see, and the princes will rise up, and they will adore, because of the Lord. For he is faithful, and he is the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.
\v 8 ¶ Thus says the Lord: In a pleasing time, I have heeded you, and in the day of salvation, I have assisted you. And I have preserved you, and I have presented you as a covenant of the people, so that you would lift up the earth, and possess the scattered inheritances,
\v 9 so that you would say to those who are bound, “Go forth!” and to those who are in darkness, “Be released!” They will pasture along the roads, and their pastures will be in every open place.
\v 10 They will not hunger or thirst, nor will the heat of the sun beat down upon them. For the one who takes pity on them will rule them, and he will give them to drink from fountains of waters.
\v 11 And I will make all my mountains into a road, and my paths will be exalted.
\v 12 Behold, some will come from far away, and behold, others from the north and from the sea, and still others from the land of the south.
\v 13 ¶ Give praise, O heavens! And exult, O earth! Let the mountains give praise with jubilation! For the Lord has consoled his people, and he will take pity on his poor ones.
\v 14 ¶ And Zion said: “The Lord has abandoned me, and the Lord has forgotten me.”
\v 15 ¶ Can a woman forget her infant, so as not to take pity on the child of her womb? But even if she would forget, still I shall never forget you.
\v 16 Behold, I have engraved you on my hands. Your walls are always before my eyes.
\v 17 Your builders have arrived. Those who would tear you down and destroy you, they will depart from you.
\v 18 Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these have been gathered together; they have come to you. As I live, says the Lord, you shall be clothed with all these things, as if with an ornament. And like a bride, you shall wrap these things all around you.
\v 19 For your deserts, and your solitary places, and the land of your ruination will now be too narrow, because of all the inhabitants. And those who devoured you will be chased far away.
\v 20 Even the children of your barrenness will say in your ears: “This place is too narrow for me. Make me a spacious place in which to dwell.”
\v 21 And you will say in your heart: “Who has conceived them? I was barren and unable to give birth. I was taken away and held captive. And so, who has raised them? I was destitute and alone. And so, where have they been?”
\v 22 ¶ Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and I will exalt my sign before the peoples. And they will carry your sons in their arms, and they will bear your daughters on their shoulders.
\v 23 And kings will be your caretakers, and queens will be your nursemaids. They will reverence you with their face to the ground, and they will lick the dust at your feet. And you will know that I am the Lord. For those who hope in him will not be confounded.
\v 24 ¶ Can prey be taken from the strong? Or is anything taken captive by the powerful able to be saved?
\v 25 For thus says the Lord: Certainly, even the captives will be taken away from the strong, even what has been taken by the powerful will be saved. And truly, I will judge those who have judged you, and I will save your children.
\v 26 And I will feed your enemies their own flesh. And they will be inebriated with their own blood, as with new wine. And all flesh will know that I am the Lord, who saves you, and your Redeemer, the Strong One of Jacob.

\cl Isaiah 50
\cd The synagogue shall be divorced for her iniquities. Christ for her sake will endure ignominious afflictions.
\v 1 ¶ Thus says the Lord: What is this bill of divorce for your mother, by which I have dismissed her? Or who is my creditor, to whom I have sold you? Behold, you were sold by your iniquities, and I have dismissed your mother for your wickedness.
\v 2 For I arrived, and there was no man. I called out, and there was no one who would hear. Has my hand been shortened and become small, so that I am unable to redeem? Or is there no power in me to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke, I will make the sea into a desert. I will turn rivers into dry land. The fish will rot for lack of water and will die of thirst.
\v 3 I will clothe the heavens in darkness, and I will make sackcloth their covering.
\v 4 ¶ The Lord has given me a learned tongue, so that I would know how to uphold with a word, one who has weakened. He rises in the morning, he rises to my ear in the morning, so that I may heed him like a teacher.
\v 5 The Lord God has opened my ear. And I do not contradict him. I have not turned back.
\v 6 I have given my body to those who strike me, and my cheeks to those who plucked them. I have not averted my face from those who rebuked me and who spit on me.
\v 7 The Lord God is my helper. Therefore, I have not been confounded. Therefore, I have set my face like a very hard rock, and I know that I will not be confounded.
\v 8 He who justifies me is near. Who will speak against me? Let us stand together. Who is my adversary? Let him approach me.
\v 9 Behold, the Lord God is my helper. Who is the one who would condemn me? Behold, they will all be worn away like a garment; the moth will devour them.
\v 10 ¶ Who is there among you who fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of his servant? Who has walked in darkness, and there is no light in him? Let him hope in the name of the Lord, and let him lean upon his God.
\v 11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, wrapped in flames: walk in the light of your fire and in the flames that you have kindled. This has been done to you by my hand. You will sleep in anguish.

\cl Isaiah 51
\cd An exhortation to trust in Christ. He shall protect the children of his church.
\v 1 ¶ Listen to me, you who follow what is just and who seek the Lord. Pay attention to the rock from which you have been hewn, and to the walls of the pit from which you have been dug.
\v 2 Pay attention to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who bore you. For I called him alone, and I blessed him, and I multiplied him.
\v 3 Therefore, the Lord will console Zion, and he will console all its ruins. And he will turn her desert into a place of delights, and her wilderness into a garden of the Lord. Gladness and rejoicing will be found in her, thanksgiving and a voice of praise.
\v 4 ¶ Pay attention to me, my people, and listen to me, my tribes. For a law will go forth from me, and my judgment will rest as a light for the nations.
\v 5 My just one is near. My savior has gone forth. And my arms will judge the people. The islands will hope in me, and they will patiently wait for my arm.
\v 6 Lift up your eyes to heaven, and look down to the earth below. For the heavens will vanish like smoke, and the earth will be worn away like a garment, and its inhabitants will pass away in like manner. But my salvation will be forever, and my justice will not fail.
\v 7 ¶ Listen to me, you who know what is just, my people who have my law in their heart. Do not be afraid of disgrace among men, and do not dread their blasphemies.
\v 8 For the worm will consume them like a garment, and the moth will devour them like wool. But my salvation will be forever, and my justice will be from generation to generation.
\v 9 Rise up, Rise up! Clothe yourself in strength, O arm of the Lord! Rise up as in the days of antiquity, as in generations long past. Have you not struck the arrogant one and wounded the dragon?
\v 10 Have not you dried up the sea, the waters of the great abyss, and turned the depths of the sea into a road, so that the delivered could cross over it?
\v 11 And now, those who have been redeemed by the Lord will return. And they will arrive in Zion, praising. And everlasting rejoicing will be upon their heads. They will take hold of gladness and rejoicing. Anguish and mourning will flee away.
\v 12 It is I, I myself, who will console you. Who are you that you would be afraid of a mortal man, and of a son of man, who will wither like the grass?
\v 13 And have you forgotten the Lord, your Maker, who extended the heavens, and who founded the earth? And have you been in constant dread, all day long, at the face of his fury, of the one who afflicted you and who had prepared to destroy you? Where is the fury of the oppressor now?
\v 14 Advancing quickly, he will arrive to be revealed, and he will not kill unto utter destruction, nor will his bread fail.
\v 15 But I am the Lord, your God, who stirs up the sea, and who makes the waves swell. The Lord of hosts is my name.
\v 16 I have placed my words in your mouth, and I have protected you in the shadow of my hand, so that you might plant the heavens, and found the earth, and so that you might say to Zion, “You are my people.”
\v 17 ¶ Lift up, Lift up! Arise, O Jerusalem! You drank, from the hand of the Lord, the cup of his wrath. You drank, even to the bottom of the cup of deep sleep. And you were given to drink, all the way to the dregs.
\v 18 There is no one who can uphold her, out of all the sons whom she has conceived. And there is no one who would take her by the hand, out of all the sons whom she has raised.
\v 19 There are two things which have happened to you. Who will be saddened over you? There is devastation and destruction, and famine and sword. Who will console you?
\v 20 Your sons have been cast out. They have slept at the head of all the roads, and they have been ensnared like a gazelle. They have been filled by the indignation of the Lord, by the rebuke of your God.
\v 21 ¶ Therefore, listen to this, O poor little ones, and you who have been inebriated, but not by wine.
\v 22 Thus says your Sovereign, the Lord, and your God, who will fight on behalf of his people: Behold, I have taken the cup of deep sleep from your hand. You shall no longer drink from the bottom of the cup of my indignation.\f + \fr 51:22 \ft The cup of deep sleep refers to the abomination of desolation, which is a perverse imitation of the holy Eucharist. Those who drink it willingly are like men who have been drugged, like men who are asleep to conscience and to truth.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 23 And I will set it in the hand of those who have humiliated you, and who have said to your soul: “Bow down, so that we pass over.” And you placed your body on the ground, as a path for them to pass over.

\cl Isaiah 52
\cd Under the figure of the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity, the church is invited to rejoice for her redemption from sin. Christ’s kingdom shall be exalted.
\v 1 ¶ Rise up, Rise up! Clothe yourself in strength, O Zion! Put on the garments of your glory, O Jerusalem, the city of the Holy One! For the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer pass through you.
\v 2 Shake yourself from the dust! Arise and sit up, O Jerusalem! Loose the chains from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion!
\v 3 For thus says the Lord: You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money.
\v 4 ¶ For thus says the Lord God: My people descended into Egypt, in the beginning, in order to sojourn there. But the Assyrian oppressed them, without any cause at all.
\v 5 And now, what is left for me here, says the Lord? For my people have been taken away without cause. Their lords treat them unjustly, says the Lord. And my name is being continually blasphemed all day long.
\v 6 Because of this, my people will know my name, in that day. For it is I myself who is speaking. Behold, I am here.
\v 7 ¶ How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger and the preacher of peace! Announcing good and preaching peace, they are saying to Zion, “Your God will reign!”\f + \fr 52:7 \ft In my interpretation, the two persons referred to here are the two prophets of Revelation.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 8 It is the voice of your watchmen. They have lifted up their voice. They will praise together. For they will see eye to eye, when the Lord converts Zion.
\v 9 ¶ Be glad and rejoice together, O deserts of Jerusalem! For the Lord has consoled his people. He has redeemed Jerusalem.
\v 10 The Lord has prepared his holy arm, in the sight of all the Gentiles. And all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
\v 11 Depart, depart, get out of here! Do not be willing to touch what is polluted. Go out from her midst! Be cleansed, you who bear the vessels of the Lord.
\v 12 For you will not go out in a tumult, nor will you take flight in a hurry. For the Lord will precede you, and the God of Israel will gather you.
\v 13 ¶ Behold, my servant will understand; he will be exalted and lifted up, and he will be very sublime.
\v 14 Just as they were stupefied over you, so will his countenance be without glory among men, and his appearance, among the sons of men.
\v 15 He will sprinkle many nations; kings will close their mouth because of him. And those to whom he was not described, have seen. And those who have not heard, have considered.

\cl Isaiah 53
\cd A prophecy of the passion of Christ.
\v 1 ¶ Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
\v 2 And he will rise up like a tender plant in his sight, and like a root from the thirsty ground. There is no beautiful or stately appearance in him. For we looked upon him, and there was no aspect, such that we would desire him.
\v 3 He is despised and the least among men, a man of sorrows who knows infirmity. And his countenance was hidden and despised. Because of this, we did not esteem him.
\v 4 ¶ Truly, he has taken away our weaknesses, and he himself has carried our sorrows. And we thought of him as if he were a leper, or as if he had been struck by God and humiliated.
\v 5 But he himself was wounded because of our iniquities. He was bruised because of our wickedness. The discipline of our peace was upon him. And by his wounds, we are healed.
\v 6 We have all gone astray like sheep; each one has turned aside to his own way. And the Lord has placed all our iniquity upon him.
\v 7 He was offered up, because it was his own will. And he did not open his mouth. He will be led like a sheep to the slaughter. And he will be mute like a lamb before his shearer. For he will not open his mouth.
\v 8 He was lifted up from anguish and judgment. Who will describe his life? For he has been cut off from the land of the living. Because of the wickedness of my people, I have struck him down.
\v 9 And he will be given a place with the impious for his burial, and with the rich for his death, though he has done no iniquity, nor was deceit in his mouth.
\v 10 ¶ But it was the will of the Lord to crush him with infirmity. If he lays down his life because of sin, he will see offspring with long lives, and the will of the Lord will be directed by his hand.
\v 11 Because his soul has labored, he will see and be satisfied. By his knowledge, my just servant will himself justify many, and he himself will carry their iniquities.
\v 12 Therefore, I will allot to him a great number. And he will divide the spoils of the strong. For he has handed over his life to death, and he was reputed among criminals. And he has taken away the sins of many, and he has prayed for the transgressors.

\cl Isaiah 54
\cd The Gentiles, who were barren before, shall multiply in the church of Christ: from which God’s mercy shall never depart.
\v 1 ¶ Give praise, you who are barren and unable to conceive. Sing praise and make a joyful noise, you who have not given birth. For many are the children of the desolate, more so than of her who has a husband, says the Lord.
\v 2 Enlarge the place of your tent and extend the skins of your tabernacles, unsparingly. Lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
\v 3 For you shall extend to the right and to the left. And your offspring shall inherit the nations, and you shall inhabit the desolate cities.
\v 4 Do not be afraid! For you will not be confounded, and you will not blush. And you will not be put to shame, because you shall forget the confusion of your youth, and you shall no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.
\v 5 For the One who made you will rule over you. The Lord of hosts is his name. And your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, will be called the God of all the earth.
\v 6 For the Lord has called you, like a woman forsaken and mourning in spirit, and like a wife rejected in her youth, said your God.
\v 7 For a brief moment, I have forsaken you, and with great pities, I will gather you.
\v 8 In a moment of indignation, I have hidden my face from you, for a little while. But with everlasting mercy, I have taken pity on you, said your Redeemer, the Lord.
\v 9 For me, it is just as in the days of Noah, to whom I swore that I would no longer bring in the waters of Noah over the earth. Thus have I sworn not to be angry with you, and not to rebuke you.
\v 10 For the mountains will be moved, and the hills will tremble. But my mercy will not depart from you, and the covenant of my peace will not be shaken, said the Lord, who has compassion on you.
\v 11 ¶ O poor little ones, convulsed by the tempest, away from any consolation! Behold, I will set your stones in order, and I will lay your foundation with sapphires,
\v 12 and I will make your ramparts out of jasper, and your gates out of sculpted stones, and all your borders out of desirable stones.
\v 13 All your children will be taught by the Lord. And great will be the peace of your children.
\v 14 And you will be founded in justice. Depart far from oppression, for you will not be afraid. And depart from terror, for it will not approach you.
\v 15 Behold, a settler will arrive, who was not with me, a certain new arrival will be joined to you.
\v 16 Behold, I created the smith who fans the coals of the fire and produces an object by his work, and I have created the slayer who destroys.

\v 2 Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and expend your labor for what does not satisfy? Listen very closely to me, and eat what is good, and then your soul will be delighted by a full measure.
\v 3 Incline your ear and draw near to me. Listen, and your soul will live. And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, by the faithful mercies of David.
\v 4 Behold, I have presented him as a witness to the people, as a commander and instructor to the nations.
\v 5 Behold, you will call to a nation that you did not know. And nations that did not know you will rush to you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel. For he has glorified you.
\v 6 ¶ Seek the Lord, while he is able to be found. Call upon him, while he is near.
\v 7 Let the impious one abandon his way, and the iniquitous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and he will take pity on him, and to our God, for he is great in forgiveness.
\v 8 ¶ For my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways, says the Lord.
\v 9 For just as the heavens are exalted above the earth, so also are my ways exalted above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts.
\v 10 And in the same manner as rain and snow descend from heaven, and no longer return there, but soak the earth, and water it, and cause it to bloom and to provide seed to the sower and bread to the hungry,
\v 11 so also will my word be, which will go forth from my mouth. It will not return to me empty, but it will accomplish whatever I will, and it will prosper in the tasks for which I sent it.
\v 12 For you will go forth rejoicing, and you will be led forward in peace. The mountains and the hills will sing praise before you, and all the trees of the countryside will clap their hands.
\v 13 In place of the shrub, the pine tree will arise, and in place of the nettle, the myrtle tree will grow. And the Lord will be named with an eternal sign, which will not be taken away.

\v 2 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds to this, keeping the Sabbath and not profaning it, guarding his hands and not doing any evil.
\v 3 ¶ And let not the son of the new arrival, who adheres to the Lord, speak, saying, “The Lord will divide and separate me from his people.” And let not the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
\v 4 For thus says the Lord to the eunuchs: They will keep my Sabbaths, and they will choose the things that I will, and they will hold to my covenant.
\v 5 I will give them a place in my house, within my walls, and a name better than sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name, which will never perish.
\v 6 And the sons of the new arrival, who adhere to the Lord so as to worship him and to love his name, shall be his servants: all who keep the Sabbath without profaning it, and who hold to my covenant.
\v 7 I will lead them to my holy mountain, and I will gladden them in my house of prayer. Their holocausts and their victims will be pleasing to me upon my altar. For my house will be called the house of prayer for all peoples.
\v 8 ¶ The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, says: Even now, I will gather his congregation to him.
\v 9 ¶ All beasts of the field, all the beasts of the forest: approach and devour!
\v 10 His watchmen are all blind. They are all ignorant. They are mute dogs without the ability to bark, seeing empty things, sleeping and loving dreams.
\v 11 And these very imprudent dogs have never known satisfaction. The shepherds themselves do not know understanding. All have turned aside in their own way, each one to his own avarice, from the highest even to the least:

\v 4 Whom are you mocking? Against whom have you opened your mouth wide and wagged your tongue? Are you not sons of wickedness, a lying offspring,
\v 5 who are being consoled by idols under every leafy tree, immolating little children at the torrents, under the high rocks?
\v 6 Your portion is in the currents of the torrent; this is your lot! And you yourselves have poured out libations to them; you have offered sacrifice. Should I not be angry over these things?
\v 7 Upon a high and lofty mountain, you have placed your bed, and you have ascended to that place to immolate victims.
\v 8 And behind the door, and beyond the post, you have set up your memorial. For you uncovered yourself next to me, and you received an adulterer. You widened your bed, and you formed a pact with them. You loved their bed with an open hand.
\v 9 And you have adorned yourself for the king with ointments, and you have increased your cosmetics. You have sent your representatives to distant places, and you have debased yourself all the way to Hell.
\v 10 You have been wearied by the multitude of your own ways. Yet you did not say, “I will cease.” You have found life by your own hand; because of this, you have not prayed.
\v 11 For whose sake have you been anxiously afraid, so that you would lie and not be mindful of me, nor consider me in your heart? For I am silent, and I am like someone who does not see, and so you have forgotten me.
\v 12 I will announce your justice, and your works will not benefit you.
\v 13 ¶ When you cry out, let your followers free you. But the wind will carry them all away; a breeze will take them up. But he who has faith in me will inherit the earth and will possess my holy mountain.
\v 14 And I will say: “Make way! Grant passage! Move to the side of the path! Take the obstacles out of the way of my people!”
\v 15 For this is said by the Most High, the Sublime One, who dwells in eternity. And his name is Holy, for he dwells in the exalted and holy place, and he acts with a restrained and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
\v 16 For I will not contend unceasingly, and I will not be angry to the end. For I will exhale my breath, and the Spirit will go forth from my face.
\v 17 Because of the iniquity of his avarice, I was angry, and I struck him down. I concealed my face from you, and I was angry. And he went astray by wandering in his heart.
\v 18 I saw his ways, and I healed him, and I led him back again, and I restored consolations to him and to those who mourn for him.
\v 19 I created the fruit of the lips: peace, peace to him who is far away, and peace to him who is near, said the Lord, and I healed him.

\v 3 ¶ “Why have we fasted, and you have not taken notice? Why have we humbled our souls, and you have not acknowledged it?” Behold, in the day of your fasting, your own will is found, and you petition for payment from all your debtors.
\v 4 Behold, you fast with strife and contention, and you strike with the fist impiously. Do not choose to fast as you have done even to this day. Then your outcry will be heard on high.
\v 5 ¶ Is this a fast such as I have chosen: for a man to afflict his soul for a day, to contort his head in a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? Should you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?
\v 6 Is not this, instead, the kind of fast that I have chosen? Release the constraints of impiety; relieve the burdens that oppress; freely forgive those who are broken; and break apart every burden.
\v 7 Break your bread with the hungry, and lead the destitute and the homeless into your house. When you see someone naked, cover him, and do not despise your own flesh.
\v 8 Then your light will break forth like the morning, and your health will improve quickly, and your justice will go before your face, and the glory of the Lord will gather you up.
\v 9 Then you will call, and the Lord will heed; you will cry out, and he will say, “Here I am,” if you take away the chains from your midst, and cease to point your finger and to speak what is not beneficial.
\v 10 When you pour out your life for the hungry, and you satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light will rise up in darkness, and your darkness will be like the midday.
\v 11 And the Lord will give you rest continually, and he will fill your soul with splendor, and he will free your bones, and you will be like a watered garden and like a fountain of water whose waters will not fail.
\v 12 And places that have been desolate for ages will be built up by you. You will raise a foundation for generation after generation. And you will be called the repairer of hedges, who turns the roadways into quiet places.
\v 13 ¶ If you restrain your foot on the Sabbath, from doing your own will on my holy day, and if you call the Sabbath delightful, and the Holy of the Lord glorious, and if you glorify him, while you do not act according to your own ways, and your own will is not found, not even to speak a word,
\v 14 then you will find delight in the Lord, and I will take you up, above the heights of the earth, and I will nourish you with the inheritance of Jacob, your father. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

\cl Isaiah 59
\cd The dreadful evil of sin is displayed, as the great obstacle to all good from God: yet he will send a Redeemer, and make an everlasting covenant with his church.
\v 1 ¶ Behold, the hand of the Lord has not been shortened, so that it cannot save, and his ear has not been blocked, so that it cannot hear.
\v 2 But your iniquities have made a division between you and your God, and your sins have concealed his face from you, so that he would not hear.
\v 3 For your hands have been polluted by blood, and your fingers by iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue utters iniquity.
\v 4 There is no one who calls for justice, and there is no one who judges truly. For they trust in nothing, and they speak emptiness. They have conceived hardship, and they have given birth to iniquity.
\v 5 They have ruptured the eggs of asps, and they have woven the webs of spiders. Whoever will eat of their eggs will die. For what has been incubated will hatch into a king snake.
\v 6 Their weavings will not be for clothing, nor will they cover themselves with their handiwork. Their works are useless things, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.
\v 7 Their feet run to evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are useless thoughts; devastation and destruction are in their ways.
\v 8 They have not known the way of peace, and there is no judgment in their steps. Their paths have become crooked for them. Anyone who treads in them knows no peace.
\v 9 ¶ Because of this, judgment is far from us, and justice will not take hold of us. We waited for light, and behold, darkness; we waited for brightness, and we walked in darkness.
\v 10 We groped for the wall, like one who is blind, and we felt our way, like one without eyes. We stumbled at midday, as if in darkness; and in darkness, as if in death.
\v 11 We will all roar like bears, and we will sigh like despondent doves. We hoped for judgment, and there is none; for salvation, and it is far from us.
\v 12 For our iniquities have been multiplied in your sight, and our sins have answered us. For our wickedness is with us, and we have acknowledged our iniquities:
\v 13 sinning and lying against the Lord. And we have turned away, not so as to go after our God, and so that we were speaking calumny and transgression. We have conceived, and spoken from the heart, words of falsehood.
\v 14 And judgment has been turned backwards, and justice has stood far away. For truth has fallen down in the street, and fairness was not able to enter.
\v 15 And the truth has gone into oblivion. And he who withdraws from evil endures plunder. And the Lord saw this, and it seemed evil in his eyes. For there is no judgment.
\v 16 ¶ And he saw that there was no good man. And he was astonished that there was no one to meet him. And his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice strengthened him.\f + \fr 59:16 \ft Although ‘vir’ is usually translated as ‘man,’ it is derived from the Latin word meaning strong or virtuous, so it sometimes has the meaning of a good man, not just any man.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 17 He clothed himself with justice as with a breastplate, and with a helmet of salvation upon his head. He put on the vestments of vengeance, and he was covered with zeal as with a cloak.
\v 18 This was for vindication, as a repayment of indignation to his adversaries, and as a sudden reversal for his enemies. He will repay the islands in their turn.
\v 19 And those from the west will fear the name of the Lord, and those from the rising of the sun will fear his glory, when he arrives like a violent river, which the Spirit of the Lord urges on.
\v 20 ¶ And the Redeemer will arrive in Zion, and to those who return from the iniquity within Jacob, says the Lord.
\v 21 This is my pact with them, says the Lord. My Spirit is within you, and my words, which I have put in your mouth, will not withdraw from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring’s offspring, says the Lord, from this moment, and even forever.\f + \fr 59:21 \fk This is my covenant, etc: \ft Note here a clear promise of perpetual orthodoxy to the church of Christ.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 2 For behold, darkness will cover the earth, and thick darkness will cover the peoples. Then the Lord will rise above you, and his glory will be seen in you.
\v 3 And the nations will walk in your light, and the kings will walk by the splendor of your rising.
\v 4 Lift up your eyes all around and see! All these have been gathered together; they have arrived before you. Your sons will arrive from far away, and your daughters will rise up from your side.
\v 5 Then you will see, and you will overflow, and your heart will be amazed and expanded. When the multitude of the sea will have been converted to you, the strength of the nations will approach you.
\v 6 A multitude of camels will inundate you: the dromedaries from Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba will arrive, carrying gold and frankincense, and announcing praise to the Lord.
\v 7 All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together before you; the rams of Nebaioth will minister to you. They will be offered upon my pleasing altar, and I will glorify the house of my majesty.
\v 8 Who are these ones, who fly like the clouds and like doves to their windows?
\v 9 For the islands await me, and the ships of the sea in the beginning, so that I may lead your sons from far away, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the Lord your God and to the Holy One of Israel. For he has glorified you.
\v 10 And the sons of sojourners will build up your walls, and their kings will minister to you. For in my wrath, I have struck you. And in my reconciliation, I have taken pity on you.
\v 11 And your gates will be open continually. They will not be closed day or night, so that the strength of the nations may be brought before you, and their kings may be lead in.
\v 12 For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve you will perish. And the Gentiles will be devastated by solitude.
\v 13 The glory of Lebanon will arrive before you, the fir tree and the box tree and the pine tree together, to adorn the place of my sanctification. And I will glorify the place of my feet.
\v 14 And the sons of those who humiliate you will approach and will bow down before you. And all who detract you will reverence the path of your feet. And they will call you the City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
\v 15 For though you were forsaken, and held in hatred, and there was no one who would pass near you, I will establish you as an everlasting glory, as a gladness from generation to generation.
\v 16 And you will drink the milk of the Gentiles, and you will be nursed at the breasts of kings, and you will know that I am the Lord, your Savior and your Redeemer, the Strong One of Jacob.
\v 17 In exchange for brass, I will bring gold; and in exchange for iron, I will bring silver; and for wood, brass; and for stones, iron. And I will make your visitation into peace, and your leaders into justice.
\v 18 Iniquity will no longer be heard in your land, nor devastation and destruction in your borders. And salvation will occupy your walls, and praise will occupy your gates.
\v 19 The sun will no longer be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon illuminate you. Instead, the Lord will be an everlasting light for you, and your God will be your glory.\f + \fr 60:19 \fk Thou shalt no more, etc: \ft In this latter part of the chapter, the prophet passes from the illustrious promises made to the church militant on earth, to the glory of the church triumphant in heaven.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 21 And your people will all be just. They will inherit the earth in perpetuity, the seedling of my planting, the work of my hand, so as to glorify me.

\v 1 ¶ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord has anointed me. He has sent me to bring good news to the meek, so as to heal the contrite of heart, to preach leniency to captives and release to the confined,
\v 2 and so to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vindication of our God: to console all who are mourning,
\v 3 to take up the mourners of Zion and to give them a crown in place of ashes, an oil of joy in place of mourning, a cloak of praise in place of a spirit of grief. And there, they shall be called the strong ones of justice, the planting of the Lord, unto glorification.
\v 4 ¶ And they will rebuild the deserted places of past ages, and they will raise up the ruins of antiquity, and they will repair the desolate cities, which had been dissipated for generation after generation.
\v 5 And foreigners will stand up and will pasture your flocks. And the sons of sojourners will be your farmers and the workers of your vineyards.
\v 6 But you yourselves will be called the priests of the Lord. It will be said to you, “You are the ministers of our God.” You will eat from the strength of the Gentiles, and you will pride yourself on their glory.
\v 7 ¶ Instead of your double confusion and shame, they will praise their portion. Because of this, they will possess double in their land. Everlasting joy will be for them.
\v 8 For I am the Lord, who loves judgment and who holds hatred for robbery within a burnt offering. And I will turn their work into truth, and I will forge a perpetual covenant with them.
\v 9 And they will know their offspring among the nations, and their progeny in the midst of the peoples. All who see them will recognize them: that these are the offspring whom the Lord has blessed.
\v 10 I will rejoice greatly in the Lord, and my soul will exult in my God. For he has clothed me with the vestments of salvation, and he has wrapped me in the clothing of justice, like a groom arrayed with a crown, and like a bride adorned with her jewels.

\v 2 And the Gentiles will see your Just One, and all the kings will see your Renowned One. And you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord will choose.
\v 3 And you shall be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
\v 4 You will no longer be called Forsaken. And your land will no longer be called Desolate. Instead, you shall be called My Will within it, and your land shall be called Inhabited. For the Lord has been well pleased with you, and your land will be inhabited.
\v 5 ¶ For the young man will live with the virgin, and your children will live with you. And the groom will rejoice over the bride, and your God will rejoice over you.
\v 6 Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have stationed watchmen all day and all night unceasingly; they will not be silent. You who are mindful of the Lord, you should not be silent,

\v 2 So then, why is your garment red, and why are your vestments like the ones of those who tread the winepress?
\v 3 I have trod the winepress alone. And among the nations, there is no man beside me. I have trampled on them in my fury, and I have tread them down in my wrath. And so, their blood has been sprinkled on my vestments, and I have stained all my garments.
\v 4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart. The year of my redemption has arrived.
\v 5 I gazed around, and there was no one to assist. I sought, and there was no one who would help. And so, my own arm has saved for me, and my own wrath itself has assisted me.
\v 6 And I have trampled the peoples in my fury, and I have inebriated them with my indignation, and I have torn down their strength to the ground.
\v 7 ¶ I will remember the compassion of the Lord, the praise of the Lord over all that the Lord has bestowed on us, and over the multitude of his good things for the house of Israel, which he has granted to them according to his leniency, and according to the multitude of his mercies.
\v 8 And he said: “Yet truly, these are my people, sons who have not been disowned.” And he became their Savior.
\v 9 Throughout all their tribulation, he was not troubled, for the Angel of his presence saved them. With his love, and by his leniency, he has redeemed them, and he has carried them and lifted them up, throughout all the days of the ages.
\v 10 ¶ But they themselves provoked to wrath and afflicted his Holy Spirit, and he was turned to be for them like an enemy, and he himself went to war against them.
\v 11 ¶ And he remembered the days of ancient times, the days of Moses and his people. Where is he who led them out of the sea, with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who placed his Holy Spirit in their midst?
\v 12 He led Moses by the right hand, with the arm of his majesty. He split the waters before them, in order to make an everlasting name for himself.

\v 17 Those who were sanctified, who thought themselves to be clean in the gardens behind the inner gate, who were eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse: they will be consumed all at once, says the Lord.\f + \fr 66:17 \ft This verse indicates that the abomination of desolation is associated with swine’s flesh and the flesh of mice. Those who conduct the false worship associated with the abomination think themselves to be clean and safe and sanctified. They will all perish together.\fl (Conte)\f*
\v 18 But I know their works and their thoughts. I am arriving, so that I may gather them together with all nations and languages. And they will approach, and they will see my glory.
\v 19 And I will set a sign among them. And I will send some of those who will have been saved to the Gentiles in the sea, to Africa, and to those who draw the bow in Lydia, to Italy and Greece, to islands far away, to those who have not heard of me, and to those who have not seen my glory. And they will announce my glory to the Gentiles.
\v 20 And they will lead all of your brothers from all of the Gentiles as a gift to the Lord, on horses, and in four-horse chariots, and on stretchers, and on mules, and in coaches, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, in the same manner that the sons of Israel would carry an offering in a pure vessel into the house of the Lord.
\v 21 And I will take from them to be priests and Levites, says the Lord.
\v 22 For in like manner as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will cause to stand before me, says the Lord, so will your offspring and your name stand.
\v 23 And there will be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath. And all flesh will approach, so as to adore before my face, says the Lord.
\v 24 And they will go out, and they will view the carcasses of the men who have transgressed against me. Their worm will not die, and their fire will not be extinguished. And they will be a sight to all flesh even unto revulsion.
