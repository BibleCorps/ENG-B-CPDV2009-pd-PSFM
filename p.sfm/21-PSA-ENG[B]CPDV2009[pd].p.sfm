\mt1 The Book of Psalms
\im The psalms are called by the Hebrews TEHILLIM, that is, Hymns of Praise. The author, of a great part of them at least, was king David: but many are of opinion that some of them were made by Asaph, and others whose names are prefixed in the titles.
\ip The numbering of the Psalms used in the CPDV is the same as the numbering in the Sixtus V and Clement VIII Latin Vulgate, with a few minor changes. The more typical numbering seen in many other versions of the Bible in English is according to the Hebrew text. 
\ip In translating the Psalms, this translation chooses accuracy and a more literal rendering, over looser and more poetic phrasing of the text. The reason is that a looser translation, obscures some of the meaning.
\ip Many of the psalms had introductions prefixed to them. These are presented here in an alternate font, but are considered scripture by the Church. These introduction include several recurring phrases. 
\ili “In parts”: Usually, ‘finem’ refers to the end or limit of something, but the root of the word is related to ‘findo,’ which means to divide into parts. Thus the word ‘finem’ typically means ‘the last part.’ But, in the context of the Psalms, which were in ancient times, as they are still today, sung or chanted, the phrase ‘in finem’ can mean ‘in parts.’ This expression refers to a song that is divided into different singing parts (e.g. a duet, or a song with parts for a chorus and parts for individuals), or to a poem that is divided into different speaking parts. 
\ili “Unto the end:” However, there is a more meaningful translation of ‘in finem.’ The notes of the Douay-Rheims version interpret ‘in finem’ (‘unto the end’) to refer to the New Testament: ‘pertaining unto the new Testament.’ And the Wycliffe version translates ‘in finem’ as ‘for victories,’ i.e. pertaining to a successful end. Thus, ‘in finem’ in this translation is usually rendered as ‘unto the end,’ since this translation makes the most fulfilling meanings most accessible.
\ili “According to verses:” The word ‘carminibus’ refers to a card for working with wool or flax. It is a card with many divisions or parts. In this context, ‘carminibus’ refers to the division of the psalm into verses. In ancient times, the Bible was not divided into verses. Perhaps the first application of this concept to the Bible was in the psalms, which had to be divided into verses, because it is poetry and because it is sung.
\ili “Musical Intruments:” The word ‘carminibus’ in the Hebrew is ‘neghinoth,’ supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.

\cl Psalm 1
\s2 Beatus vir.
\cd The happiness of the just and the evil state of the wicked.
\q1
\v 1 Blessed\f + \fr 1:1 \fk blessed: \ft He is in the right way to eternal happiness. \fl (Douay)\f* is the man who has not followed the counsel of the impious,\f + \fr 1:1 \fk not followed the counsel of the impious: \ft not consented to evil suggestions.\fl (Douay)\f*
\q2 and has not remained in the way of sinners,\f + \fr 1:1 \fk not remained in the way of sinners: \ft not continued in sin.\fl (Douay)\f*
\q2 and has not sat in the chair of pestilence.\f + \fr 1:1 not sat in the chair of pestilence: \ft not finally persisted in wicked life.\fl (Douay)\f*\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or, more loosely translated: “Blessed is the man who has not followed the advice of the impious, and has not stood in the street among sinners, and has not sat in the company of complainers.”\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 2 But his will is with the law of the Lord,
\q2 and he will meditate on his law, day and night.
\q1
\v 3 And he will be like a tree that has been planted beside running waters,
\q2 which will provide its fruit in its time,
\q2 and its leaf will not fall away,
\q2 and all things whatsoever that he does will prosper.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Not so the impious, not so.
\q2 For they are like the dust that the wind casts along the face of the earth.
\q1
\v 5 Therefore, the impious will not prevail again in judgment,
\q2 nor sinners in the council of the just.\f + \fr 1:5 \fk prevail again: \ft The verb ‘resurgent’ could be translated as ‘prevail again’ or as ‘rise up again.’ The translation ‘the impious will not rise up again in the judgment’ is avoided because both the just and the unjust will rise again at the general resurrection on the day of judgment.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 6 For the Lord knows the way of the just.
\q2 And the path of the impious will pass away.
\c 2
\cl Psalm 2
\s2 Quare fremuerunt.
\cd The vain efforts of persecutors against Christ and his church.
\q1
\v 1 Why have the Gentiles been seething,
\q2 and why have the people been pondering nonsense?\f + \fr 2:1 \ft The word ‘gentes’ can be translated as ‘Gentiles,’ or as ‘nations,’ or as ‘peoples.’ When translated as ‘Gentiles,’ and when viewed from a present-day Catholic perspective, it refers not to non-Jews, but to non-believers.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth have stood up,
\q2 and the leaders have joined together as one,
\q2 against the Lord and against his Christ:
\q1
\v 3 “Let us shatter their chains
\q2 and cast their yoke away from us.”
\q1
\v 4 He who dwells in heaven will ridicule them,
\q2 and the Lord will mock them.
\q1
\v 5 Then will he speak to them in his anger
\q2 and trouble them with his fury.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Yet I have been appointed king by him over Zion,
\q2 his holy mountain, preaching his precepts.
\q1
\v 7 The Lord has said to me: You are my son,
\q2 this day have I begotten you.\f + \fr 2:7 \ft The phrase ‘Filius meus es tu’ is a good example of how word order in Latin differs from word order in English. The word order in English is exactly the reverse of the word order in Latin. To translate, one must read the entire phrase before giving the first word of the translation.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 8 Ask of me and I will give to you: the Gentiles for your inheritance,
\q2 and the ends of the earth for your possession.
\q1
\v 9 You will rule them with an iron rod,
\q2 and you will shatter them like a potter’s vessel.
\b
\q1
\v 10 And now, O kings, understand.
\q2 Receive instruction, you who judge the earth.\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More literally: ‘Be taught, you who judge the land.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 11 Serve the Lord in fear,
\q2 and exult in him with trembling.
\q1
\v 12 Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord might become angry,
\q2 and you would perish from the way of the just.\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Notice the use of the subjunctive tense here, and its translation. God may become angry, and then you would perish from the just way.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 13 Though his wrath can flare up in a short time,
\q2 blessed are all those who trust in him.
\c 3
\cl Psalm 3
\s2 Domine, quid multiplicati.
\cd The prophet’s danger and delivery from his son Absalom: mystically, the passion and resurrection of Christ.
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David. When he fled from the face of his son, Absalom.
\q1
\v 2 Lord, why have those who trouble me been multiplied?
\q2 Many rise up against me.
\q1
\v 3 Many say to my soul,
\q2 “There is no salvation for him in his God.”\f + \fr 3:3 \fk Salvation: \ft The word ‘salus’ can mean ‘salvation,’ or ‘safety,’ or ‘health.’\fl (Conte)\f* \qs Pause\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 4 But you, Lord, are my supporter,
\q2 my glory, and the one who raises up my head.
\q1
\v 5 I have cried out to the Lord with my voice,
\q2 and he has heard me from his holy mountain. \qs Pause\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 6 I have slept, and I have been stupefied.
\q2 But I awakened because the Lord has taken me up.\f + \fr 3:6 \ft The verb ‘soporatus sum’ does not refer to normal sleep. It refers to being knocked unconscious or being put to sleep by something (extreme weariness, medication, etc.). It can also mean, more loosely, to be stupefied or dumbstruck. The reference to sleep in this verse is metaphorical, so ‘stupefied’ works better than ‘unconscious.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 7 I will not fear the thousands of people surrounding me.
\b
\q1 Rise up, Lord. Save me, my God.\f + \fr 3:7 \fk Save me, my God: \ft Or, ‘Accomplish my salvation, my God.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q2
\v 8 For you have struck all those who oppose me without cause.
\q1 You have broken the teeth of sinners.
\q2
\v 9 Salvation is of the Lord,
\q1 and your blessing is upon your people. \qs Pause\qs*
\c 4
\cl Psalm 4
\s2 Cum invocarem.
\cd The prophet teaches us to flee to God in tribulation, with confidence in him.
\d
\v 1 In parts according to verses. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 4:1 \fk For David, or to David: \ft That is, inspired to David himself, or to be sung.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 2 When I called upon him, the God of my justice heeded me.
\q2 In tribulation, you have enlarged me.
\q2 Have mercy on me, and heed my prayer.
\q1
\v 3 Sons of men, how long will you be dull in heart,
\q2 so that whatever you love is in vain, and whatever you seek is false? \qs Pause\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 4 And know this: the Lord has made wondrous his holy one.
\q2  The Lord will heed me when I cry out to him.
\q1
\v 5 Be angry, and do not be willing to sin.
\q2 The things that you say in your hearts:
\q1 be sorry for them on your beds. \qs Pause\qs*
\q1
\v 6 Offer the sacrifice of justice,
\q2 and hope in the Lord.
\b
\q1 Many say, “Who reveals to us what is good?”
\q2
\v 7 The light of your countenance, Lord, has been sealed upon us.
\q1 You have given joy to my heart.
\q2
\v 8 By the fruit of their grain, wine,
\q1 and oil, they have been multiplied.
\q1
\v 9 In peace itself, I will sleep and I will rest.\f + \fr 4:9 \ft Or, ‘In peace, in the very same, I will sleep and I will rest.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q2
\v 10 For you, O Lord, have established me singularly in hope.\f + \fr 4:10 \ft The term ‘singulariter’ could refer to God who alone establishes me in hope, or it could refer to being established in hope alone or in hope in a singular manner.\fl (Conte)\f*
\c 5
\cl Psalm 5
\s2 Verba mea auribul.
\cd A prayer to God against the iniquities of men.
\d
\v 1 Unto the end.\f + \fr 4:1 \fk Unto the end: \ft Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcomes: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.\fl (Challoner)\f* For her who pursues the inheritance. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 5:1 \fk For her that obtains the inheritance: \ft That is, for the church of Christ.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 2 O Lord, listen closely to my words.
\q2 Understand my outcry.
\q1
\v 3 Attend to the voice of my prayer, my King and my God.
\q2
\v 4 For to you, I will pray.
\q1 In the morning, Lord, you will hear my voice.
\q2
\v 5 In the morning, I will stand before you, and I will see.
\b
\q1 For you are not a God who wills iniquity.
\q2
\v 6 And the malicious will not dwell close to you,
\q1 nor will the unjust endure before your eyes.
\q2
\v 7 You hate all who work iniquity.
\q1 You will destroy all who speak a lie.
\q2 The bloody and deceitful man, the Lord will abominate.
\b
\q1
\v 8 But I am in the multitude of your mercy.
\q2 I will enter your house.
\q1 I will show adoration toward your holy temple,
\q2 in your fear.\f + \fr 5:8 \ft The humanity of Christ is a Temple united to His Divinity.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 9 Lord, lead me in your justice. Because of my enemies,
\q2 direct my way in your sight.
\b
\q1
\v 10 For there is no truth in their mouth:
\q2 their heart is vain.
\q1
\v 11 Their throat is an open sepulcher.
\q2 They have acted deceitfully with their tongues.
\q1 Judge them, O God.
\q2 Let them fall by their own intentions:
\q1 according to the multitude of their impiety, expel them.
\q2 For they have provoked you, O Lord.
\b
\q1
\v 12 But let all those who hope in you rejoice.
\q2 They will exult in eternity, and you will dwell in them.
\q1 And all those who love your name will glory in you.
\q2
\v 13 For you will bless the just.
\q1 You have crowned us, O Lord, as if with a shield of your good will.
\c 6
\cl Psalm 6
\s2 Domine, ne in furore.
\cd A prayer of a penitent sinner, under the scourge of God. The first penitential psalm.
\d
\v 1 In parts according to verses. A Psalm of David. For the octave.\f + \fr 6:1 \fk For the octave: \ft That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings. St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life: and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 2 O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury,
\q2 nor chastise me in your anger.
\q1
\v 3 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak.
\q2 Heal me, Lord, for my bones have become disturbed,
\q1
\v 4 and my soul has been very troubled.
\q2 But as for you, Lord, when?
\b
\q1
\v 5 Turn to me, Lord, and rescue my soul.
\q2 Save me because of your mercy.
\q1
\v 6 For there is no one in death who would be mindful of you.
\q2 And who will confess to you in Hell?
\q1
\v 7 I have labored in my groaning.
\q2 Every night, with my tears, I will wash my bed and drench my blanket.
\q1
\v 8 My eye has been troubled by rage.
\q2 I have grown old among all my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Scatter before me, all you who work iniquity,
\q2 for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
\q1
\v 10 The Lord has heard my supplication.
\q2 The Lord has accepted my prayer.
\q1
\v 11 Let all my enemies be ashamed and together be greatly troubled.
\q2 May they be converted and become ashamed very quickly.
\c 7
\cl Psalm 7
\s2 Domine, Deus meus.
\cd David, trusting in the justice of his cause, prays for God’s help against his enemies.
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Cush, the son of Jemini.
\q1
\v 2 O Lord, my God, in you I have hoped.
\q2 Save me from all those who persecute me, and free me:
\q1
\v 3 lest at any time, like a lion,
\q2 he might seize my soul, while there is no one to redeem me, nor any who can save.
\b
\q1
\v 4 O Lord, my God, if there is iniquity in my hands,
\q2 if I have done this:
\q1
\v 5 if I have repaid those who rendered evils to me,
\q2 may I deservedly fall away empty before my enemies:
\q2
\v 6 let the enemy pursue my soul, and take hold of it,
\q1 and trample my life into the earth,
\q2 and drag down my glory into the dust. \qs Pause\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 7 Rise up, Lord, in your anger.
\q2 And be exalted to the borders of my enemies.
\q1 And rise up, O Lord my God, according to the precept that you commanded,
\q2
\v 8 and a congregation of people will surround you.
\q2 And, because of this, return on high.
\q1
\v 9 The Lord judges the people.
\q2 Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice
\q2 and according to my innocence within me.
\q1
\v 10 The wickedness of sinners will be consumed,
\q2 and you will direct the just:
\q2 the examiner of hearts and temperaments is God.\f + \fr 7:10 \ft The word ‘renes’ literally means ‘kidneys,’ but it is used metaphorically to refer to one’s temperament.\fl (Conte)\f*
\b
\q1
\v 11 Just is my help from the Lord,
\q2 who saves the upright of heart.
\q1
\v 12 God is a just judge, strong and patient.
\q2 How could he be angry throughout every day?
\q1
\v 13 Unless you will be converted, he will brandish his sword.
\q2 He has extended his bow and made it ready.
\q1
\v 14 And with it, he has prepared instruments of death.
\q2 He has produced his arrows for those on fire.\f + \fr 7:14 \fk For them that burn: \ft That is, against the persecutors of his saints.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 15 Behold him who has given birth to injustice:
\q2 he has conceived sorrow and has begotten iniquity.
\q1
\v 16 He has opened a pit and enlarged it.
\q2 And he has fallen into the hole that he made.
\q1
\v 17 His sorrow will be turned upon his own head,
\q2 and his iniquity will descend upon his highest point.
\b
\q1
\v 18 I will confess to the Lord according to his justice,
\q2 and I will sing a psalm to the name of the Lord Most High.
\c 8
\cl Psalm 8
\s2 Domine, Dominus noster.
\cd God is wonderful in his works; especially in mankind, singularly exalted by the incarnation of Christ.
\d
\v 1 Unto the end. For the oil and wine presses. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 8:1 \ft The word ‘torcularibus’ refers to oil and wine presses. This psalm is a prayer praising God’s magnificence as displayed in the abundance that comes to us from nature.\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 8:1 \fk The presses: \ft In Hebrew, Gittith, supposed to be a musical instrument.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 2 O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth!
\q2 For your magnificence is elevated above the heavens.
\q1
\v 3 Out of the mouths of babes and infants, you have perfected praise,
\q2 because of your enemies, so that you may destroy the enemy and the revenger.\f + \fr 8:3 \ft The word ‘lactentium’ literally refers to infants who are still nursing; and the word ‘infantium’ more generally refers to young children. Despite the similarity to the English word ‘infant,’ the word ‘infantium’ is better rendered as babes or toddlers, and ‘lactentium’ is a better fit for ‘infants.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 4 For I will behold your heavens, the works of your fingers:
\q2 the moon and the stars, which you have founded.
\q1
\v 5 What is man, that you are mindful of him,
\q2 or the son of man, that you visit him?
\q1
\v 6 You reduced him to a little less than the Angels;
\q2 you have crowned him with glory and honor,
\q1
\v 7 and you have set him over the works of your hands.
\q2
\v 8 You have subjected all things under his feet,
\q1 all sheep and oxen, and in addition: the beasts of the field,
\q2
\v 9 the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,
\q2 which pass through the paths of the sea.
\q1
\v 10 O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name
\q2 throughout all the earth!
\c 9
\cl Psalm 9 \ca (9 - 10)\ca*
\s2 Confitebor tibi, Domine.
\cd The church praises God for his protection against her enemies.
\d
\v 1 Unto the end. For the secrets of the Son. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 9:1 \ft Or, ‘for the hidden things of the Son.’ Some psalms have an introductory verse that often contains an instruction concerning the reciting or singing of the psalm, or a statement about its topic, or dedication, or purpose. Even the most devout and knowledgeable Christian does not know everything, or even most things that could be known about the Son. He is ever partially hidden from our view.\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 9:1 \fk The hidden things of the Son: \ft The humility and sufferings of Christ, the Son of God; and of good Christians, who are his sons by adoption; are called hidden things, with regard to the children of this world, who know not the value and merit of them.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 2 I will confess to you, Lord, with my whole heart.
\q2 I will recount all your wonders.
\q1
\v 3 I will rejoice and exult in you.
\q2 I will sing a psalm to your name, O Most High.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For my enemy will be turned back.
\q2 They will be weakened and perish before your face.
\q1
\v 5 For you have accomplished my judgment and my cause.
\q2 You have sat upon the throne that judges justice.
\q1
\v 6 You have rebuked the Gentiles,
\q2 and the impious one has perished.
\q2 You have deleted their name in eternity and for all generations.\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Their name has been deleted in eternity (Heaven) and for all future generations on earth. For at the general Resurrection God takes away Heaven and earth, and He makes a new Heaven and a new earth.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 7 The spears of the enemy have failed in the end,
\q1 and their cities, you have destroyed.
\q2 Their memory has perished with a loud noise.
\b
\q1
\v 8 But the Lord remains in eternity.
\q2 He has prepared his throne in judgment.
\q1
\v 9 And he will judge the whole world in equity.
\q2 He will judge the people in justice.
\q1
\v 10 And the Lord has become a refuge for the poor,
\q2 a helper in opportunity, in tribulation.
\q1
\v 11 And may they hope in you, who know your name.
\q2 For you have not abandoned those seeking you, Lord.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Sing a psalm to the Lord, who dwells in Zion.
\q2 Announce his study among the Gentiles.\f + \fr 9:12 \ft The word ‘studia’ refers to a topic of study, devotion, or interest. The topic is the teaching of the Church.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 13 Because of those who yearned for their blood, he has remembered them.
\q2 He has not forgotten the cry of the poor.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Have mercy on me, Lord.
\q2 See my humiliation from my enemies.
\q1
\v 15 You lift me up from the gates of death,
\q2 so that I may announce all your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion.\f + \fr 9:15 \ft Or, ‘at the gates of daughter Zion.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q2
\v 16 I will exult in your salvation.
\q1 The Gentiles have become trapped in the ruin that they made.
\q2  Their foot has been caught in the same snare that they themselves had hidden.
\q1
\v 17 The Lord will be recognized when making judgments.
\q2 The sinner has been caught in the works of his own hands.\qs Pause\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 18 The sinners will be turned into Hell:
\q2 all the Gentiles who have forgotten God.\f + \fr 9:18 \ft Gentiles, in this context, refers to any and all who ignore or reject God, to non-believers rather merely to non-Jews.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 19 For the poor will not be forgotten in the end.
\q2 The patience of the poor will not perish in the end.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Rise up, Lord: do not let man be strengthened.
\q2 Let the Gentiles be judged in your sight.
\q1
\v 21 O Lord, establish a lawgiver over them,
\q2 so that the Gentiles may know that they are only men.\f + \fr 9:21 \ft Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22 the beginning of Psalm 10. And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible.\fl (Challoner)\f* \qs Pause\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 22 So then, why, O Lord, have you withdrawn far away?
\q2 Why have you overlooked us in opportunity, in tribulation?
\b
\q1
\v 23 While the impious is arrogant, the poor is enflamed.
\q2 They are held by the counsels that they devise.
\q1
\v 24 For the sinner is praised by the desires of his soul,
\q2 and the iniquitous is blessed.\f + \fr 9:24 \ft The meaning is that the sinner is given praise for his sins by the sinful desires in his soul, and likewise, the iniquitous person is given blessings by the iniquity in his soul. In this context, the word ‘benedicitur’ is not a euphemism for cursing. One finds this euphemism in Job 2:9, where the wife of Job is speaking about God. She says ‘Bless God,’ because she dare not say the words ‘Curse God.’ However, Scripture itself, when explaining the truth to us, does not refrain from using the word ‘curse.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 25 The sinner has provoked the Lord;
\q2 according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him.
\q1
\v 26 God is not before his sight. His ways are stained at all times.
\q2 Your judgments are removed from his face.
\q1 He will be master of all his enemies.
\q2
\v 27 For he has said in his heart, “I will not be disturbed:
\q2 from generation to generation without evil.”\f + \fr 9:27 \ft The word ‘movebor’ can be translated as ‘moved’ or as ‘disturbed.’ The word ‘malo’ can be translated as ‘evil’ or as ‘misfortune’ or ‘disaster.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 28 His mouth is full of curses, and bitterness, and deceit.
\q2 Under his tongue are hardship and sorrow.
\q1
\v 29 He sits in ambush, with resources in hidden places,
\q2 so that he may execute the innocent.
\q1
\v 30 His eyes catch sight of the poor.
\q1 He lies in ambush, in hiding like a lion in his den.
\q2 He lies in ambush, so that he may seize the poor,
\q2 to seize the poor as he draws him in.
\b
\q1
\v 31 With his snare, he will bring him down.
\q2 He will crouch down and pounce, when he has power over the poor.
\q1
\v 32 For he has said in his heart, “God has forgotten,
\q2 he has turned away his face, lest he see to the end.”
\b
\q1
\v 33 O Lord God, rise up.
\q2 Let your hand be exalted. Do not forget the poor.
\q1
\v 34 How has the impious one provoked God?
\q2 For he has said in his heart, “He will not inquire.”
\q1
\v 35 You do see, for you examine hardship and sorrow,
\q2 so that you may deliver them into your hands.
\q1 The poor one has been abandoned to you.
\q2 You will be a helper to the orphan.

\q1 And my cry in his presence entered into his ears.

\q1
\v 8 The earth was shaken, and it trembled.
\q2 The foundations of the mountains were disturbed,

\q2 coals were kindled by it.

\v 10 He bent the heavens, and they descended.
\q2 And darkness was under his feet.
\q1
\v 11 And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew:
\q2 he flew upon the feathers of the winds.

\v 12 And he set darkness as his hiding place,
\q2 with his tabernacle all around him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.

The word ‘cantabimus’ can refer to singing songs or playing a musical instrument. The overall meaning of those two words used together, in this context, is to play musical instruments and to sing psalms or hymns to God.\fl (Conte)\f*

\q1
\v 22 Save me from the mouth of the lion,
\q1 and my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast.\f + \fr 21:22 \fk Single-horned beast: \ft The word ‘unicornium’ does not refer to the mythical horse with a single horn. It refers literally to some type of wild animal with one horn in ancient times. This animal is most likely some species that has since gone extinct. Some have speculated that it could refer to the rhinoceros of India (Rhinoceros unicornis), which has one horn, unlike its African cousin, which has two horns. It also has a figurative meaning. Notice that the first part of the verse refers to being saved by lions. It is not the case that the Israelites were largely afraid of being eaten by lions; rather, the lion is figurative for a king or for governmental authority. Save me from governmental authority gone astray. Likewise, save my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast. This beast could represent law enforcement and military bodies gone astray. Guns and tanks can be figuratively said to have a single horn, yet they shoot many horns (bullets, etc.) from their single horn. May I be humble in the face of law enforcement and military authorities gone astray. The single-horned beast can also be said to be a figure of the Antichrist’s kingdom. The figure of a horn is often used in the Old Testament to signify a leader of a kingdom. The Antichrist’s kingdom has a single horn, in the sense that he is one leader who will have dominion over nearly the whole world. And it has many horns, in that there are many other leaders who exercise authority under the Antichrist.\fl (Conte)\f*

I shall not want.” cannot be arrived at from the Latin. There is no mention of shepherd, but of the Lord guiding or directing.

After that Sabbath, the counting of the Feast of Weeks begins with the very next day. The first week in the counting of the Feast of Weeks ends with the second First Sabbath, that is, the First Sabbath in the count of Seven Sabbaths leading up to the Feast of Weeks. Because there was no clear concept of a number zero (which would, in modern counting be the first Sabbath of Passover), there must be two first Sabbaths.\fl (Conte)\f*

The Rock upon which he is exalted is the Church. This psalm is about David, who composed psalms to the Lord; therefore, the translation ‘compose a psalm’ is more fitting than merely ‘recite a psalm.’ Also, the word psalm is singular here. If the meaning were merely to recite rather than to compose, then the word psalm would likely be plural.\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 2 In you, Lord, I have hoped; let me never be confounded. In your justice, deliver me.

\q1 Be for me a protector God and a house of refuge,

\q1
\v 6 Into your hands, I commend my spirit.
\q1 You have redeemed me, O Lord, God of truth.
\q1
\v 7 You have hated those who practice emptiness to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord.
\q1
\v 8 I will exult and rejoice in your mercy.
\q1 For you have looked upon my humility;
\q1 you have saved my soul from needfulness.
\q1
\v 9 And you have not enclosed me in the hands of the enemy.
\q1 You have set my feet in a spacious place.
\q1
\v 10 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am troubled.
\q1 My eye has been disturbed by wrath, along with my soul and my gut.
\q1
\v 11 For my life has fallen into sorrow, and my years into sighing.
\q1 My virtue has been weakened in poverty,
\q1 and my bones have been disturbed.
\q1
\v 12 I have become a disgrace among all my enemies,
\q1 and even more so to my neighbors, and a dread to my acquaintances.
\q1 Those who catch sight of me, flee away from me.
\q1
\v 13 I have become forgotten, like one dead to the heart.
\q1 I have become like a damaged utensil.
\q1
\v 14 For I have heard the harsh criticism of many who linger in the area.\f + \fr 30:14 \fk Linger in the area: \ft The phrase ‘commorantium in circuitu’ refers to people who are not living in the general area, but who have come to the area and are lingering there. The phrase ‘in eo’ refers to the phrase ‘in circuitu,’ i.e. it refers to a place, so it is translated loosely as ‘there,’ rather than as ‘in it.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1 While assembled together against me in that place,
\q1 they deliberated on how to take away my life.
\q1
\v 15 But I have hoped in you, O Lord. I said, “You are my God.”

\v 17 Shine your face upon your servant. Save me in your mercy.

\v 18 Do not let me be confounded, Lord, for I have called upon you.
\q1 Let the impious be ashamed and be drawn down into Hell.
\q1
\v 19 May deceitful lips be silenced: those that speak iniquity against the just,
\q1 in arrogance and in abusiveness.
\q1
\v 20 How great is the multitude of your sweetness, O Lord,
\q1 which you keep hidden for those who fear you,
\q1 which you have perfected for those who hope in you,
\q1 in the sight of the sons of men.

\v 21 You hide them in the concealment of your face, from the disturbance of men.
\q1 You protect them in your tabernacle, from the contradiction of tongues.
\q1
\v 22 Blessed is the Lord. For he has shown his wonderful mercy to me, in a fortified city.
\q1
\v 23 But I said in the excess of my mind:
\q1 “I have been cast away from the glance of your eyes.”
\q1 And so, you heeded the voice of my prayer,

\v 24 Love the Lord, all you his saints.

\v 1 The understanding of David himself.\f + \fr 31:1 \fk The understanding of David: \ft Or, “The understanding of David to himself.” Or, “David’s own understanding.” This phrase has been often misunderstood. The word ‘intellectus’ is nominative, so it is the subject. The name David, and other non-Latin names written in Latin, often do not change their ending, despite being in various cases in various sentences. The word ‘David’ in this sentence is genitive (the understanding of David, or, David’s understanding). The word ‘ipsi’ is dative (to himself), but in English we would express this idea not by saying ‘The understanding of David to himself,’ but by saying, ‘The understanding of David himself.’ In other words, this psalm is about David’s own understanding. It is a psalm that describes things from David’s point of view.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1 Blessed are they whose iniquities have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered.
\q1
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin,
\q1 and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

\q1
\v 4 For, day and night, your hand was heavy upon me.
\q1 I have been converted in my anguish, while still the thorn is piercing.\f + \fr 31:4 \fk I am turned, etc: \ft That is, I turn and roll about in my bed to seek for ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh, and sticks fast in me. Or, I am turned: that is, I am converted to you, my God, by being brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements. In the Hebrew it is, my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 5 I have acknowledged my offense to you,
\q1 and I have not concealed my injustice.
\q1 I said, “I will confess against myself, my injustice to the Lord,”
\q1 and you forgave the impiety of my sin.

\v 6 For this, everyone who is holy will pray to you in due time.
\q1 Yet truly, in a flood of many waters, they will not draw near to him.\f + \fr 31:6 \ft A flood immediately precedes the reign of the Antichrist over the world. Those who repent before God will not draw near to him (the Antichrist) during that time.\fl (Conte)\f*

\q1 The unjust will be punished, and the offspring of the impious will perish.\f + \fr 36:28 \ft The phrase ‘offspring of,’ or ‘sons of,’ is a figure of speech often used in the Old Testament. It does not literally mean that a child will perish if his parents sin. It means that if you sin continually, you are acting as if you were the offspring of sin. Thus, ‘semen impiorum peribit’ could be translated as ‘the offspring of impiety will perish.’ In another example, the ‘sons of adultery’ are not the biological sons of adulterers, but they are those who act as if they had adultery itself as a parent. This figure of speech is predicated on the idea that children learn most from their parents. If you commit adultery, it is as if your parents were adulterers, or as if your parent was adultery itself.\fl (Conte)\f*

\q1
\v 38 But the unjust will be destroyed together:
\q1 the allotments of the impious will pass away.\f + \fr 36:38 \ft The word ‘interibunt’ literally means ‘they will go between.’ This was an expression used to refer to going between this life and the next, i.e. passing away or crossing over.

\v 2 O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your wrath.

\q1
\v 4 There is no health in my flesh before the face of your wrath.

However, ‘divites’ is clearly masculine plural: ‘all the rich men of the people.’ Ordinarily, a translator ought to prefer to translate one noun with one noun, but English does not allow one to indicate gender, even with many words that refer to people, such as ‘the rich’ or ‘the wealthy.’ Since the first part of the verse is clearly referring to the women of wealthy Tyre, the last part is also specifically meant to indicate the successful wealthy men among the people (not merely any or all of the people.

A Psalm for the sons of Korah.\f + \fr 46:1 \ft Notice that this verse has ‘pro filiis Core,’ whereas other Psalms have simply ‘filiis Core.’ Thus, the translation of this verse is ‘for the sons of Korah,’ whereas the other verses should be translated as ‘to the sons of Korah,’ or, more loosely, ‘of the sons of Korah.’\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 1 A Canticle Psalm. To the sons of Korah, on the second Sabbath.\f + \fr 47:1 \ft The second Sabbath is the second of the seven Sabbaths after Passover, counting towards the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost). This verse calls to mind the mention of the second first Sabbath in the Gospel. The first Sabbath is the Sabbath during Passover (zero in the count of the seven weeks and seven Sabbaths leading up to the Feast of Weeks). The second first Sabbath is the first Sabbath after Passover (one in the same count).\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 5 For behold, the kings of the earth have been gathered together; they have convened as one.
\q1
\v 6 Such did they see, and they were astonished:

\q1
\v 7 Trembling took hold of them. In that place,

\q1
\v 2 Hear these things, all nations. Pay attention, all inhabitants of the world:
\q1
\v 3 whoever is earth-born, you sons of men,
\q1 together as one, the rich and the poor.
\q1
\v 4 My mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will speak prudence.
\q1
\v 5 I will incline my ear to a parable.
\q1 I will open my case with the psaltery.\f + \fr 48:5 \ft Although the word ‘psalterio’ refers to an ancient stringed musical instrument, it brings to mind the Psalter (the Psalms), and our Lady’s Psalter (the Rosary).\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 6 Why should I fear in the evil day?
\q1 The iniquity at my heel will surround me.\f + \fr 48:6 \fk The iniquity at my heel: \ft That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned and kicked at my neighbours: or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the iniquity in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of hell shall find me?\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 7 Those who trust in their own strength and who glory in the multitude of their riches,\f + \fr 48:7 \fk They that trust, etc: \ft As much as to say, let them fear that trust in their strength or riches: for they have great reason to fear: seeing no brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 8 no brother redeems, nor will man buy back.
\q1 He will not give to God his appeasement,
\q1
\v 9 nor the price for the redemption of his soul.
\q1 And he will labor continuously,\f + \fr 48:9 \fk And shall labour for ever, etc: \ft This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence: as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the end of the world. Others understand it of the eternal sorrows, and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in sin.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\v 10 and he will still live, until the end.
\q1
\v 11 He will not see death, when he sees the wise dying:\f + \fr 48:11 \fk He will not see death, etc: \ft Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt from dying.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1 the foolish and the senseless will perish together.
\q1 And they will leave their riches to strangers.
\q1
\v 12 And their sepulchers will be their houses forever,
\q1 their tabernacles from generation to generation.
\q1 They have called their names in their own lands.\f + \fr 48:12 \ft In this last part, ‘nomina sua’ is accusative, not nominative. They (the sepulchers) have called their names in their own lands. In other words, their deaths and their final resting place is calling for them.\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 48:12 \fk They have called, etc: \ft That is, they have left their names on their graves, which alone remain of their lands.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 13 And man, when he was held in honor, did not understand.
\q1 He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them.
\q1
\v 14 This way of theirs is a scandal to them.
\q1 And afterwards, they will delight in their mouth.\f + \fr 48:14 \fk They shall delight in their mouth: \ft Notwithstanding the wretched way in which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and glory in their doings.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 15 They have been placed in Hell like sheep. Death will feed on them.
\q1 And the just will have dominion over them in the morning.
\q1 And their help will grow old in Hell for their glory.\f + \fr 48:15 \fk In the morning: \ft That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the just shall judge and condemn the wicked.\fl (Challoner)\f*\f + \fr 48:15 \fk From their glory: \ft That is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no more.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 16 Even so, truly God will redeem my soul from the hand of Hell, when he will receive me.
\q1
\v 17 Do not be afraid, when a man will have been made rich,
\q1 and when the glory of his house will have been multiplied.
\q1
\v 18 For when he dies, he will take nothing away,
\q1 and his glory will not descend with him.
\q1
\v 19 For his soul will be blessed in his lifetime,
\q1 and he will admit to you when you do good to him.

\v 3 Be merciful to me, O God, according to your great mercy.
\q1 And, according to the plentitude of your compassion, wipe out my iniquity.

\v 4 Wash me once again from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

\v 6 Against you only have I sinned, and I have done evil before your eyes.
\q1 And so, you are justified in your words,
\q1 and you will prevail when you give judgment.
\q1
\v 7 For behold, I was conceived in iniquities,
\q1 and in sinfulness did my mother conceive me.
\q1
\v 8 For behold, you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your wisdom, you have manifested to me.
\q1
\v 9 You will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed.
\q1 You will wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow.
\q1
\v 10 In my hearing, you will grant gladness and rejoicing.
\q1 And the bones that have been humbled will exult.
\q1
\v 11 Turn your face away from my sins, and erase all my iniquities.

\v 12 Create a clean heart in me, O God.
\q1 And renew an upright spirit within my inmost being.
\q1
\v 13 Do not cast me away from your face;
\q1 and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.\f + \fr 50:13 \ft The words ‘Spiritum Sanctum’ have been capitalized, and are translated as ‘Holy Spirit’ because this translation takes the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church. The Old Testament is therefore seen in the light of the New Testament and of the teachings of the Church.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 14 Restore to me the joy of your salvation,

\q1
\v 4 All day long your tongue thinks up injustice.
\q1 Like a sharp razor, you have wrought deceit.

\v 9 I waited for him who saved me from a weak-minded spirit and from a tempest.\f + \fr 54:9 \ft The word ‘pusillanimitate’ is actually two Latin words put together. The first refers to a very young animal, but is used to express the idea of weakness. The second word refers to the mind, or soul, or spirit. The effect of putting the two words together results in an expression of the idea of a weak soul or a weak mind. Thus, ‘pusillanimitate spiritus’ refers to a weak-minded soul. The last word, ‘tempestate,’ in this context, refers not to a literal wind-storm, but to a tempest of the mind and soul, i.e. to inner turmoil. It can also be taken to refer to a storm of words or of various kinds of opposition to truth and justice.\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 8 My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared.
\q1 I will sing, and I will compose a psalm.\f + \fr 56:8 \ft Again, ‘psalmum dicam’ could be translated as ‘recite a psalm.’ But, after all the great and merciful things that this and other psalms say that God has done, is the response of the Psalmist merely to recite a psalm. Is not the one who wrote this psalm a composer of psalms? So then, his response would not be merely to recite a memorized psalm, but to compose one. Psalms were composed in ancient times, not so much by sitting down and writing, but by speaking the psalm first, and writing it later.\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 1 Unto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title.
\q1
\v 2 If, truly and certainly, you speak justice,
\q1 then judge what is right, you sons of men.
\q1
\v 3 For, even in your heart, you work iniquity.
\q1 Your hands construct injustice on the earth.
\q1
\v 4 Sinners have become foreigners from the womb;
\q1 they have gone astray from conception. They have been speaking falsehoods.\f + \fr 57:4 \ft The word ‘vulva’ is feminine and refers to the womb or to the female’s generative capability. The word ‘utero’ is masculine and, in this context, refers to the male generative capability. It is not a second reference to the womb. Here the Scriptures are saying that the sinful tendencies of human persons comes from being conceived of fallen men and fallen women.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 5 Their fury is similar to that of a serpent;
\q1 it is like a deaf asp, who even blocks her ears,
\q1
\v 6 who will not listen to the voice of charmers,
\q1 nor even to the enchanter who chants wisely.
\q1
\v 7 God will crush their teeth within their own mouth.

\v 8 They will come to nothing, like water flowing away.
\q1 He has aimed his bow, while they are being weakened.

\q1 Fire has fallen upon them, and they will not see the sun.
\q1
\v 10 Before your thorns could know the brier,
\q1 he consumes them alive, as if in rage.\f + \fr 57:10 \ft The expression ‘absorbet eos viventes’ is figurative, as indicated by ‘sicut.’ However, it is already clear in the English translation that ‘swallowing them alive’ or ‘consuming them alive’ is a figure of speech, so a word-for-word translation of ‘sicut’ is not necessary. The meaning of ‘sicut’ is implied in the English text.\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 57:10 \fk Before your thorns, etc: \ft That is, before your thorns grow up, so as to become strong briers, they shall be overtaken and consumed by divine justice, swallowing them up, as it were, alive in his wrath.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\v 11 The just one will rejoice when he sees vindication.
\q1 He will wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.\f + \fr 57:11 \fk Shall wash his hands, etc: \ft Shall applaud the justice of God, and take occasion from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked to wash and cleanse his hands from sin.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 12 And man will say, “If the just one is fruitful, then,
\q1 truly, there is a God judging them on earth.”\f + \fr 57:12 \ft Here the word ‘justo’ is singular, so it could be translated as ‘the just man,’ referring, on one level, to Christ. The teachings and sacrifice of Jesus Christ bear fruit, so man concludes that there is a God who judges the earth. But, on another level, the word ‘justo’ refers to the just in general, as indicated by the plural word ‘eos.’\fl (Conte)\f*

\q1
\v 9 And you, O Lord, will laugh at them.
\q1 You will lead all the Gentiles to nothing.\f + \fr 58:9 \ft In this context, from the point of view of Catholicism, the ‘Gentes’ (Gentiles) are not the non-Jews, but rather the non-believers, those who reject God and His Way.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 10 I will guard my strength toward you, for you are God, my supporter.\f + \fr 58:10 \ft The Douay-Rheims and Challoner Douay-Rheims lack the word ‘God’ in this verse, even though the Clementine Vulgate has the word God. Occasional differences between the Douay and the Clementine Vulgate lead me to conclude that Challoner et al. were working from a slightly different edition of the Sixtus V and Clement VIII Latin Vulgate than I have available to me.\fl (Conte)\f*

\q1 Do not slay them, lest at times my people may forget them. Scatter them by your virtue.
\q1 And depose them, O Lord, my protector,

\v 4 How is it that you rush against a man?
\q1 Every one of you puts to death, as if you were pulling down a ruined wall,
\q1 leaning over and falling apart.\f + \fr 61:4 \ft The word ‘parieti’ refers to a ruined wall. The addition of the phrase ‘inclinato et maceriæ,’ further describes the wall as leaning over and falling apart. The word ‘maceriæ’ is often used to describe a garden wall, because garden walls have no mortar; they are simply one stone on another. Thus the word ‘maceriæ,’ in this context, refers to a wall that has lost its mortar and is therefore falling apart.\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 5 So, truly, they intended to reject my price. I ran in thirst.

It is best expressed by rephrasing the sentence so that the search is the subject: ‘their exhaustive search has failed,’ rather than ‘they have failed in their exhaustive search.’ The meaning is that the wicked have searched for iniquities so as to make an accusation against the just; but they fail to find any true accusation to make.\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 63:7 \fk A deep heart: \ft That is, crafty, subtle, deep projects and designs; which nevertheless shall not succeed; for God shall be exalted in bringing them to nought by his wisdom and power.\fl (Challoner)\f*\v 8 and God will be exalted.

\q1 And though it was weak, truly, you have made it perfect.\f + \fr 67:10 \fk A free rain: \ft the manna, which rained plentifully from heaven, in favour of God’s inheritance, that is, of his people Israel: which was weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions, but was made perfect by God; that is, was still supported by divine providence, and brought on to the promised land.

That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to surprise their prey. Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors, who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds, which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of the Almighty. The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine, that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried by fire.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\q1 and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel.
\q1
\v 22 For they neither put their trust in God,
\q1 nor did they hope in his salvation.
\q1
\v 23 And he commanded the clouds from above,
\q1 and he opened the doors of heaven.
\q1
\v 24 And he rained down manna upon them to eat,
\q1 and he gave them the bread of heaven.
\q1
\v 25 Man ate the bread of Angels. He sent them provisions in abundance.
\q1
\v 26 He transferred the south wind from heaven, and,

\q1
\v 38 Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them.
\q1 And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath.

\q1 And he divided their land by lot to them, with a line of distribution.
\q1
\v 55 And he caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and aggravated God Most High,
\q1 and they did not keep his testaments.

\q1
\v 5 O Lord, God of hosts, how long will you be angry over the prayer of your servant?\f + \fr 79:5 \ft There are two possible meanings here (at least). One meaning is that God is angry despite (over and above) the prayer of His servant. The other meaning is that He is angry at the inappropriate or sinful prayer of someone who is otherwise a servant of God. Some make the mistake of the Pharisee, praying with some degree of selfishness or self-exaltation. Prayer is not necessarily pleasing to God.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 6 How long will you feed us the bread of tears,
\q1 and give us to drink a full measure of tears?
\q1
\v 7 You have set us as a contradiction to our neighbors.

\v 9 You have transferred a vineyard from Egypt.
\q1 You have cast out the Gentiles, and planted it.

\v 10 You were the leader of the journey in its sight.
\q1 You planted its roots, and it filled the earth.
\q1
\v 11 Its shadow covered the hills, and its branches covered the cedars of God.
\q1
\v 12 It extended its new branches even to the sea,
\q1 and its new seedlings even to the river.
\q1
\v 13 So then, why have you destroyed its walls,
\q1 so that all those who pass by the way gather its grapes?
\q1
\v 14 The wild boar of the forest has trampled it,
\q1 and a single wild beast has laid waste to it.\f + \fr 79:14 \ft The word ‘exterminavit’ does not translate as ‘exterminate.’ Rather, it has the sense of crossing a limit or border, or breaking out of a limit or border. In this context, the sense is that the borders and fences of the vineyard have been broken down and trampled over. Also, the ‘singularis ferus’ could be a ‘single wild beast,’ or even a ‘singular wild beast.’\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 15 Turn back, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven,
\q1 and see, and visit this vineyard;
\q1
\v 16 and complete what your right hand has planted,

\q1
\v 17 Whatever has been set on fire and dug under will perish at the rebuke of your countenance.\f + \fr 79:17 \fk Things set on fire, etc: \ft So this vineyard of thine, almost consumed already, must perish, if you continue your rebukes.\fl (Challoner)\f*

\q1 a pleasing Psalter with stringed instruments.\f + \fr 80:3 \ft Even though the word ‘psalterium’ literally refers to an ancient type of musical instrument, it was used to accompany psalms and hymns. Therefore, the word also indirectly refers to the Psalter, that is, to the psalms and particularly to the psalms when they are sung or chanted or accompanied by music.

\v 9 My people, listen and I will call you to testify.
\q1 If, O Israel, you will pay heed to me,

\v 14 If my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways,

The translation could be ‘To this David,’ but then the word ‘this’ would not be of much use, except to indicate the case of the word ‘David,’ i.e. ‘To David,’ rather than ‘To this David.’ Another possible translation (a somewhat loose translation), would be to view ‘David’ as the subject: ‘David is for this,’ which can be rephrased in English as ‘This is for David.’\fl (Conte)\f*\f + \fr 96:1 \ft So the translation should be either: ‘To David,’ or, ‘This is for David.’ Both of which have approximately the same meaning.\fl (Conte)\f*

\v 2 O God, do not be silent toward my praise,
\q1 for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceitful one have been opened against me.
\q1
\v 3 They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues,
\q1 and they have surrounded me with hateful words,
\q1 and they fought against me over nothing.
\q1
\v 4 Instead of choosing to act on my behalf,
\q1 they detracted me. But I gave myself to prayer.\f + \fr 108:4 \ft The verb ‘diligerent’ can mean ‘to love,’ but it can also mean ‘to choose.’ In this case, his complaint is not that they don’t love him, but that they do not choose (to act) on his behalf or in his favor.\fl (Conte)\f*
\q1
\v 5 And they set evil against me, instead of good,
\q1 and hatred, in return for my love.
\q1
\v 6 Establish the sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand.\f + \fr 108:6 \fk Set you the sinner over him, etc: \ft Give to the devil, that arch-sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as curses.\fl (Challoner)\f*
\q1
\v 7 When he is judged, may he go forth in condemnation,
\q1 and may his prayer be counted as sin.
\q1
\v 8 May his days be few, and let another take his episcopate.\f + \fr 108:8 \ft This verse is applied by the Acts of the Apostles to the replacement of Judas Iscariot with Matthias as the twelfth Apostle.\fl (Conte)\f*

The meaning here is that God’s only Son was begotten in eternity, before the Angels were created, before the Angels fell from grace, before Lucifer (the light-bearer) became Satan (the adversary). The phrase ‘ex utero’ does not mean ‘from the womb,’ but has more of the meaning of ‘from conception.’ The word ‘utero’ is often used in Latin to refer to the generative capability (the ability to bring about conception) of men and women.

A Latin word is very often translated, and properly so, by one particular English word. Then along comes a context in which that Latin word actually means something else. It should be translated in this other context by another English word. But it is a common translation mistake not to do so. In this verse, the statement ‘I have loved,’ is followed, not by the reason that I loved, but by the result of that choice. I do not choose to love because I think that God will answer my prayers, but rather when I choose to love, the result is that God will answer my prayers.\fl (Conte)\f*

\q1
\v 12 They surrounded me like a swarm, and they burned like fire among the thorns.
\q1 And, in the name of the Lord, I have been avenged over them.
\q1
\v 13 Having been pushed, I was overturned so as to fall. But the Lord took me up.
\q1

\v 3 Jerusalem has been built as a city,

\q1
\v 5 For in that place, seats have sat down in judgment,
\q1 seats above the house of David.\f + \fr 121:5 \ft Jerusalem is above Bethlehem, both literally and figuratively. Figuratively, the house of David is the Jewish faith and the city of Jerusalem represents the Catholic faith.

\q1 Rescue me from the iniquitous leader.\f + \fr 139:2 \ft Here we have two different Latin words (homine, viro) that are usually translated with the same English word, ‘man.’ But the Latin word ‘viro’ can refer to a particular type of man, such as a strong man, or a virtuous man, or a man with some degree of power and authority. So, in this context, ‘viro’ is best translated as ‘leader,’ rather than translating it as ‘man.’ This allows the English translation to reflect the different use of the words in Latin: ‘homine,’ and ‘viro.’\fl (Conte)\f*
