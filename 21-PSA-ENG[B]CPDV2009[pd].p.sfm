\cl Psalm 1
\p
\v 1 Blessed is the man who has not followed the counsel of the impious, and has not remained in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the chair of pestilence.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Note about the numbering of the Psalms: The numbering of the Psalms used in the CPDV is the same as the numbering in the Sixtus V and Clement VIII Latin Vulgate, with a few minor changes. The more typical numbering seen in many other versions of the Bible in English is according to the Hebrew text.\f* \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or, more loosely translated: “Blessed is the man who has not followed the advice of the impious, and has not stood in the street among sinners, and has not sat in the company of complainers.”\f*\f + \fr 1:1 \ft The Douay-Rheims notes are particularly insightful on this verse: “Blessed [Note: [a] He is in the right way to eternal happiness. ] is the man, that hath [Note: [b] not consented to evil suggestions. ] not gone in the counsel of the impious, & hath [Note: [c] not continued in sin. ] not stood in the way of sinners, and hath [Note: [d] not finally persisted in wicked life. ] not sit in the chair of pestilence:”\f*\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Note that, in translating the Psalms, I have decided to choose accuracy and a more literal rendering, over a looser and more poetic phrasing of the text. The reason is that a looser translation, obscures some of the meaning.\f*
\p
\v 2 But his will is with the law of the Lord, and he will meditate on his law, day and night.
\p
\v 3 And he will be like a tree that has been planted beside running waters, which will provide its fruit in its time, and its leaf will not fall away, and all things whatsoever that he does will prosper.
\p
\v 4 Not so the impious, not so. For they are like the dust that the wind casts along the face of the earth.
\p
\v 5 Therefore, the impious will not prevail again in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the just.\f + \fr 1:5 \ft The verb ‘resurgent’ could be translated as ‘prevail again’ or as ‘rise up again.’ The translation ‘the impious will not rise up again in the judgment’ is avoided because both the just and the unjust will rise again at the general resurrection on the day of judgment.\f*
\p
\v 6 For the Lord knows the way of the just. And the path of the impious will pass away.
\c 2
\cl Psalm 2
\p
\v 1 Why have the Gentiles been seething, and why have the people been pondering nonsense?\f + \fr 2:1 \ft The word ‘gentes’ can be translated as ‘Gentiles,’ or as ‘nations,’ or as ‘peoples.’ When translated as ‘Gentiles,’ and when viewed from a present-day Catholic perspective, it refers not to non-Jews, but to non-believers.\f*
\p
\v 2 The kings of the earth have stood up, and the leaders have joined together as one, against the Lord and against his Christ:
\p
\v 3 “Let us shatter their chains and cast their yoke away from us.”
\p
\v 4 He who dwells in heaven will ridicule them, and the Lord will mock them.
\p
\v 5 Then will he speak to them in his anger and trouble them with his fury.
\p
\v 6 Yet I have been appointed king by him over Zion, his holy mountain, preaching his precepts.
\p
\v 7 The Lord has said to me: You are my son, this day have I begotten you.\f + \fr 2:7 \ft The phrase ‘Filius meus es tu’ is a good example of how word order in Latin differs from word order in English. The word order in English is exactly the reverse of the word order in Latin. To translate, one must read the entire phrase before giving the first word of the translation.\f*
\p
\v 8 Ask of me and I will give to you: the Gentiles for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession.
\p
\v 9 You will rule them with an iron rod, and you will shatter them like a potter’s vessel.
\p
\v 10 And now, O kings, understand. Receive instruction, you who judge the earth.\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More literally: ‘Be taught, you who judge the land.’\f*
\p
\v 11 Serve the Lord in fear, and exult in him with trembling.
\p
\v 12 Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord might become angry, and you would perish from the way of the just.\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Notice the use of the subjunctive tense here, and its translation. God may become angry, and then you would perish from the just way.\f*
\p
\v 13 Though his wrath can flare up in a short time, blessed are all those who trust in him.

\cl Psalm 3
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David. When he fled from the face of his son, Absalom.
\p
\v 2 Lord, why have those who trouble me been multiplied? Many rise up against me.
\p
\v 3 Many say to my soul, “There is no salvation for him in his God.”\f + \fr 3:3 \ft The word ‘salus’ can mean ‘salvation,’ or ‘safety,’ or ‘health.’\f*
\p
\v 4 But you, Lord, are my supporter, my glory, and the one who raises up my head.
\p
\v 5 I have cried out to the Lord with my voice, and he has heard me from his holy mountain.
\p
\v 6 I have slept, and I have been stupefied. But I awakened because the Lord has taken me up.\f + \fr 3:6 \ft The verb ‘soporatus sum’ does not refer to normal sleep. It refers to being knocked unconscious or being put to sleep by something (extreme weariness, medication, etc.). It can also mean, more loosely, to be stupefied or dumbstruck. The reference to sleep in this verse is metaphorical, so ‘stupefied’ works better than ‘unconscious.’\f*
\p
\v 7 I will not fear the thousands of people surrounding me. Rise up, Lord. Save me, my God.\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Or, ‘Accomplish my salvation, my God.’\f*
\p
\v 8 For you have struck all those who oppose me without cause. You have broken the teeth of sinners.
\p
\v 9 Salvation is of the Lord, and your blessing is upon your people.
\c 4
\cl Psalm 4
\d
\v 1 In parts according to verses. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 4:1 \ft Usually, ‘finem’ refers to the end or limit of something, but the root of the word is related to ‘findo,’ which means to divide into parts. Thus the word ‘finem’ typically means ‘the last part.’ But, in the context of the Psalms, which were in ancient times, as they are still today, sung or chanted, the phrase ‘in finem’ can mean ‘in parts.’ This expression refers to a song that is divided into different singing parts (e.g. a duet, or a song with parts for a chorus and parts for individuals), or to a poem that is divided into different speaking parts.\f*\f + \fr 4:1 \ft However, there is a more meaningful translation of ‘in finem.’ The notes of the Douay-Rheims version interpret ‘in finem’ (‘unto the end’) to refer to the New Testament: ‘pertaining unto the new Testament.’ And the Wycliffe version translates ‘in finem’ as ‘for victories,’ i.e. pertaining to a successful end. Thus, ‘in finem’ in this translation is usually rendered as ‘unto the end,’ since this translation makes the most fulfilling meanings most accessible.\f*\f + \fr 4:1 \ft The word ‘carminibus’ refers to a card for working with wool or flax. It is a card with many divisions or parts. In this context, ‘carminibus’ refers to the division of the psalm into verses. In ancient times, the Bible was not divided into verses. Perhaps the first application of this concept to the Bible was in the psalms, which had to be divided into verses, because it is poetry and because it is sung.\f*
\p
\v 2 When I called upon him, the God of my justice heeded me. In tribulation, you have enlarged me. Have mercy on me, and heed my prayer.
\p
\v 3 Sons of men, how long will you be dull in heart, so that whatever you love is in vain, and whatever you seek is false?
\p
\v 4 And know this: the Lord has made wondrous his holy one. The Lord will heed me when I cry out to him.
\p
\v 5 Be angry, and do not be willing to sin. The things that you say in your hearts: be sorry for them on your beds.
\p
\v 6 Offer the sacrifice of justice, and hope in the Lord. Many say, “Who reveals to us what is good?”
\p
\v 7 The light of your countenance, Lord, has been sealed upon us. You have given joy to my heart.
\p
\v 8 By the fruit of their grain, wine, and oil, they have been multiplied.
\p
\v 9 In peace itself, I will sleep and I will rest.\f + \fr 4:9 \ft Or, ‘In peace, in the very same, I will sleep and I will rest.’\f*
\p
\v 10 For you, O Lord, have established me singularly in hope.\f + \fr 4:10 \ft The term ‘singulariter’ could refer to God who alone establishes me in hope, or it could refer to being established in hope alone or in hope in a singular manner.\f*

\cl Psalm 5
\d
\v 1 Unto the end. For her who pursues the inheritance. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 2 O Lord, listen closely to my words. Understand my outcry.
\p
\v 3 Attend to the voice of my prayer, my King and my God.
\p
\v 4 For to you, I will pray. In the morning, Lord, you will hear my voice.
\p
\v 5 In the morning, I will stand before you, and I will see. For you are not a God who wills iniquity.
\p
\v 6 And the malicious will not dwell close to you, nor will the unjust endure before your eyes.
\p
\v 7 You hate all who work iniquity. You will destroy all who speak a lie. The bloody and deceitful man, the Lord will abominate.
\p
\v 8 But I am in the multitude of your mercy. I will enter your house. I will show adoration toward your holy temple, in your fear.\f + \fr 5:8 \ft The humanity of Christ is a Temple united to His Divinity.\f*
\p
\v 9 Lord, lead me in your justice. Because of my enemies, direct my way in your sight.
\p
\v 10 For there is no truth in their mouth: their heart is vain.
\p
\v 11 Their throat is an open sepulcher. They have acted deceitfully with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall by their own intentions: according to the multitude of their impiety, expel them. For they have provoked you, O Lord.
\p
\v 12 But let all those who hope in you rejoice. They will exult in eternity, and you will dwell in them. And all those who love your name will glory in you.
\p
\v 13 For you will bless the just. You have crowned us, O Lord, as if with a shield of your good will.

\cl Psalm 6
\d
\v 1 In parts according to verses. A Psalm of David. For the octave.
\p
\v 2 O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your anger.
\p
\v 3 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak. Heal me, Lord, for my bones have become disturbed,
\p
\v 4 and my soul has been very troubled. But as for you, Lord, when?
\p
\v 5 Turn to me, Lord, and rescue my soul. Save me because of your mercy.
\p
\v 6 For there is no one in death who would be mindful of you. And who will confess to you in Hell?
\p
\v 7 I have labored in my groaning. Every night, with my tears, I will wash my bed and drench my blanket.
\p
\v 8 My eye has been troubled by rage. I have grown old among all my enemies.
\p
\v 9 Scatter before me, all you who work iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
\p
\v 10 The Lord has heard my supplication. The Lord has accepted my prayer.
\p
\v 11 Let all my enemies be ashamed and together be greatly troubled. May they be converted and become ashamed very quickly.
\c 7
\cl Psalm 7
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Cush, the son of Jemini.
\p
\v 2 O Lord, my God, in you I have hoped. Save me from all those who persecute me, and free me:
\p
\v 3 lest at any time, like a lion, he might seize my soul, while there is no one to redeem me, nor any who can save.
\p
\v 4 O Lord, my God, if there is iniquity in my hands, if I have done this:
\p
\v 5 if I have repaid those who rendered evils to me, may I deservedly fall away empty before my enemies:
\p
\v 6 let the enemy pursue my soul, and take hold of it, and trample my life into the earth, and drag down my glory into the dust.
\p
\v 7 Rise up, Lord, in your anger. And be exalted to the borders of my enemies. And rise up, O Lord my God, according to the precept that you commanded,
\p
\v 8 and a congregation of people will surround you. And, because of this, return on high.
\p
\v 9 The Lord judges the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice and according to my innocence within me.
\p
\v 10 The wickedness of sinners will be consumed, and you will direct the just: the examiner of hearts and temperaments is God.\f + \fr 7:10 \ft The word ‘renes’ literally means ‘kidneys,’ but it is used metaphorically to refer to one’s temperament.\f*
\p
\v 11 Just is my help from the Lord, who saves the upright of heart.
\p
\v 12 God is a just judge, strong and patient. How could he be angry throughout every day?
\p
\v 13 Unless you will be converted, he will brandish his sword. He has extended his bow and made it ready.
\p
\v 14 And with it, he has prepared instruments of death. He has produced his arrows for those on fire.
\p
\v 15 Behold him who has given birth to injustice: he has conceived sorrow and has begotten iniquity.
\p
\v 16 He has opened a pit and enlarged it. And he has fallen into the hole that he made.
\p
\v 17 His sorrow will be turned upon his own head, and his iniquity will descend upon his highest point.
\p
\v 18 I will confess to the Lord according to his justice, and I will sing a psalm to the name of the Lord Most High.

\cl Psalm 8
\d
\v 1 Unto the end. For the oil and wine presses. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 8:1 \ft The word ‘torcularibus’ refers to oil and wine presses. This psalm is a prayer praising God’s magnificence as displayed in the abundance that comes to us from nature.\f*
\p
\v 2 O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth! For your magnificence is elevated above the heavens.
\p
\v 3 Out of the mouths of babes and infants, you have perfected praise, because of your enemies, so that you may destroy the enemy and the revenger.\f + \fr 8:3 \ft The word ‘lactentium’ literally refers to infants who are still nursing; and the word ‘infantium’ more generally refers to young children. Despite the similarity to the English word ‘infant,’ the word ‘infantium’ is better rendered as babes or toddlers, and ‘lactentium’ is a better fit for ‘infants.’\f*
\p
\v 4 For I will behold your heavens, the works of your fingers: the moon and the stars, which you have founded.
\p
\v 5 What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you visit him?
\p
\v 6 You reduced him to a little less than the Angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor,
\p
\v 7 and you have set him over the works of your hands.
\p
\v 8 You have subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and in addition: the beasts of the field,
\p
\v 9 the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, which pass through the paths of the sea.
\p
\v 10 O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth!

\cl Psalm 9 (9 - 10)
\d
\v 1 Unto the end. For the secrets of the Son. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 9:1 \ft Or, ‘for the hidden things of the Son.’ Some psalms have an introductory verse that often contains an instruction concerning the reciting or singing of the psalm, or a statement about its topic, or dedication, or purpose. Even the most devout and knowledgeable Christian does not know everything, or even most things that could be known about the Son. He is ever partially hidden from our view.\f*
\p
\v 2 I will confess to you, Lord, with my whole heart. I will recount all your wonders.
\p
\v 3 I will rejoice and exult in you. I will sing a psalm to your name, O Most High.
\p
\v 4 For my enemy will be turned back. They will be weakened and perish before your face.
\p
\v 5 For you have accomplished my judgment and my cause. You have sat upon the throne that judges justice.
\p
\v 6 You have rebuked the Gentiles, and the impious one has perished. You have deleted their name in eternity and for all generations.\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Their name has been deleted in eternity (Heaven) and for all future generations on earth. For at the general Resurrection God takes away Heaven and earth, and He makes a new Heaven and a new earth.\f*
\p
\v 7 The spears of the enemy have failed in the end, and their cities, you have destroyed. Their memory has perished with a loud noise.
\p
\v 8 But the Lord remains in eternity. He has prepared his throne in judgment.
\p
\v 9 And he will judge the whole world in equity. He will judge the people in justice.
\p
\v 10 And the Lord has become a refuge for the poor, a helper in opportunity, in tribulation.
\p
\v 11 And may they hope in you, who know your name. For you have not abandoned those seeking you, Lord.
\p
\v 12 Sing a psalm to the Lord, who dwells in Zion. Announce his study among the Gentiles.\f + \fr 9:12 \ft The word ‘studia’ refers to a topic of study, devotion, or interest. The topic is the teaching of the Church.\f*
\p
\v 13 Because of those who yearned for their blood, he has remembered them. He has not forgotten the cry of the poor.
\p
\v 14 Have mercy on me, Lord. See my humiliation from my enemies.
\p
\v 15 You lift me up from the gates of death, so that I may announce all your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion.\f + \fr 9:15 \ft Or, ‘at the gates of daughter Zion.’\f*
\p
\v 16 I will exult in your salvation. The Gentiles have become trapped in the ruin that they made. Their foot has been caught in the same snare that they themselves had hidden.
\p
\v 17 The Lord will be recognized when making judgments. The sinner has been caught in the works of his own hands.
\p
\v 18 The sinners will be turned into Hell: all the Gentiles who have forgotten God.\f + \fr 9:18 \ft Gentiles, in this context, refers to any and all who ignore or reject God, to non-believers rather merely to non-Jews.\f*
\p
\v 19 For the poor will not be forgotten in the end. The patience of the poor will not perish in the end.
\p
\v 20 Rise up, Lord: do not let man be strengthened. Let the Gentiles be judged in your sight.
\p
\v 21 O Lord, establish a lawgiver over them, so that the Gentiles may know that they are only men.
\p
\v 22 So then, why, O Lord, have you withdrawn far away? Why have you overlooked us in opportunity, in tribulation?
\p
\v 23 While the impious is arrogant, the poor is enflamed. They are held by the counsels that they devise.
\p
\v 24 For the sinner is praised by the desires of his soul, and the iniquitous is blessed.\f + \fr 9:24 \ft The meaning is that the sinner is given praise for his sins by the sinful desires in his soul, and likewise, the iniquitous person is given blessings by the iniquity in his soul. In this context, the word ‘benedicitur’ is not a euphemism for cursing. One finds this euphemism in Job 2:9, where the wife of Job is speaking about God. She says ‘Bless God,’ because she dare not say the words ‘Curse God.’ However, Scripture itself, when explaining the truth to us, does not refrain from using the word ‘curse.’\f*
\p
\v 25 The sinner has provoked the Lord; according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him.
\p
\v 26 God is not before his sight. His ways are stained at all times. Your judgments are removed from his face. He will be master of all his enemies.
\p
\v 27 For he has said in his heart, “I will not be disturbed: from generation to generation without evil.”\f + \fr 9:27 \ft The word ‘movebor’ can be translated as ‘moved’ or as ‘disturbed.’ The word ‘malo’ can be translated as ‘evil’ or as ‘misfortune’ or ‘disaster.’\f*
\p
\v 28 His mouth is full of curses, and bitterness, and deceit. Under his tongue are hardship and sorrow.
\p
\v 29 He sits in ambush, with resources in hidden places, so that he may execute the innocent.
\p
\v 30 His eyes catch sight of the poor. He lies in ambush, in hiding like a lion in his den. He lies in ambush, so that he may seize the poor, to seize the poor as he draws him in.
\p
\v 31 With his snare, he will bring him down. He will crouch down and pounce, when he has power over the poor.
\p
\v 32 For he has said in his heart, “God has forgotten, he has turned away his face, lest he see to the end.”
\p
\v 33 O Lord God, rise up. Let your hand be exalted. Do not forget the poor.
\p
\v 34 How has the impious one provoked God? For he has said in his heart, “He will not inquire.”
\p
\v 35 You do see, for you examine hardship and sorrow, so that you may deliver them into your hands. The poor one has been abandoned to you. You will be a helper to the orphan.
\p
\v 36 Break the arm of the sinner and the malicious. His sin will be sought, and it will not be found.\f + \fr 9:36 \ft His sin will not be found because he has been defeated by God and his sinful deeds are no more.\f*
\p
\v 37 The Lord shall reign in eternity, even forever and ever. You will perish the Gentiles from his land.
\p
\v 38 The Lord has heeded the desire of the poor. Your ear has listened to the preparation of their heart,
\p
\v 39 so as to judge for the orphan and the humble, so that man may no longer presume to magnify himself upon the earth.

\v 1 Unto the end. A Psalm of David.\f + \fr 10:1 \ft The expression, ‘in finem’ can be interpreted to refer to a psalm that is sung or recited ‘in parts.’ It can also be interpreted to mean ‘unto the end.’\f*
\p
\v 2 I trust in the Lord. How can you say to my soul, “Sojourn to the mountain, like a sparrow.”
\p
\v 3 For behold, the sinners have bent their bow. They have prepared their arrows in the quiver, so as to shoot arrows in the dark at the upright of heart.
\p
\v 4 For they have destroyed the things that you have completed. But what has the just one done?
\p
\v 5 The Lord is in his holy temple. The Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes look upon the poor. His eyelids question the sons of men.
\p
\v 6 The Lord questions the just and the impious. Yet he who loves iniquity, hates his own soul.
\p
\v 7 He will rain down snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and windstorms will be the portion of their cup.\f + \fr 10:7 \ft Or, ‘spiritual storms.’\f*

\p
\v 3 They have been speaking emptiness, each one to his neighbor; they have been speaking with deceitful lips and a duplicitous heart.\f + \fr 11:3 \ft The phrase ‘in corde et corde’ is idiomatic, meaning with a duplicitous or double heart.\f*
\p
\v 4 May the Lord scatter all deceitful lips, along with the tongue that speaks malice.
\p
\v 5 They have said: “We will magnify our tongue; our lips belong to us. What is Lord to us?”
\p
\v 6 Because of the misery of the destitute and the groaning of the poor, now I will arise, says the Lord. I will place him in safety. I will act faithfully toward him.

\v 2 How long can I take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in my heart throughout the day?
\p
\v 3 How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
\p
\v 4 Look upon me and listen to me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I fall asleep forever in death,
\p
\v 5 lest at any time my enemy may say, “I have prevailed against him.” Those who trouble me will exult, if I have been disturbed.
\p
\v 6 But I have hoped in your mercy. My heart will exult in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, who assigns good things to me. And I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord Most High.

\cl Psalm 13 \ca (14)\ca*
\d
\v 1 Unto the end. A Psalm of David.
\p The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They were corrupted, and they have become abominable in their studies. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.
\p
\v 2 The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who were considering or seeking God.
\p
\v 3 They have all gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.\f + \fr 13:3 \ft This verse in the Vulgate is very long, encompassing 13:3 through 13:6 in this renumbered version of Psalm 13. The Vulgate probably kept verse 13:3 long in order to align with the same Psalm in the Hebrew version, which has a much shorter verse 13:3. I have renumbered this Psalm for the CPDV and for my edit of the Vulgate.\f*
\p
\v 4 Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting deceitfully; the venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.
\p
\v 5 Their feet are swift to shed blood. Grief and unhappiness are in their ways; and the way of peace, they have not known.
\p
\v 6 There is no fear of God before their eyes.
\p
\v 7 Will they never learn: all those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal of bread?\f + \fr 13:7 \ft The verb ‘cognoscent’ can refer to knowing or having knowledge; it can also refer to becoming aware of something, or to learning about something.\f*
\p
\v 8 They have not called upon the Lord. There, they have trembled in fear, where there was no fear.
\p
\v 9 For the Lord is with the just generation. You have confounded the counsel of the needy because the Lord is his hope.
\p
\v 10 Who will grant the salvation of Israel from Zion? When the Lord turns away the captivity of his people, Jacob will exult, and Israel will rejoice.\f + \fr 13:10 \ft Literally, the verb ‘averterit’ is translated ‘will have turned away.’ But English tends to use the present tense in a clause such as this one. When translating, tenses do not always remain the same.\f*

\v 1 A Prayer of David.
\p Lord, listen to my justice, attend to my supplication. Pay attention to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.
\p
\v 2 Let my judgment proceed from your presence. Let your eyes behold fairness.
\p
\v 3 You have tested my heart and visited it by night. You have examined me by fire, and iniquity has not been found in me.
\p
\v 4 Therefore, may my mouth not speak the works of men. I have kept to difficult ways because of the words of your lips.
\p
\v 5 Perfect my steps in your paths, so that my footsteps may not be disturbed.
\p
\v 6 I have cried out because you, O God, have listened to me. Incline your ear to me and heed my words.
\p
\v 7 Make your mercies wonderful, for you save those who hope in you.
\p
\v 8 From those who resist your right hand, preserve me like the pupil of your eye. Protect me under the shadow of your wings,
\p
\v 9 from the face of the impious who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul.
\p
\v 10 They have concealed their fatness; their mouth has been speaking arrogantly.
\p
\v 11 They have cast me out, and now they have surrounded me. They have cast their eyes down to the earth.\f + \fr 16:11 \ft They look down on other people, even the whole world.

\v 13 Rise up, O Lord, arrive before him and displace him. Deliver my soul from the impious one: your spear from the enemies of your hand.

\v 1 Unto the end. For David, the servant of the Lord, who spoke the words of this canticle to the Lord, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he said:
\p
\v 2 I will love you, O Lord my strength.
\p
\v 3 The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my liberator. My God is my helper, and I hope in him: my protector, and the horn of my salvation, and my support.
\p
\v 4 Praising, I will call upon the Lord. And I will be saved from my enemies.
\p
\v 5 The sorrows of death surrounded me, and the torrents of iniquity dismayed me.
\p
\v 6 The sorrows of Hell encompassed me, and the snares of death intercepted me.
\p
\v 7 In my tribulation, I called upon the Lord, and I cried out to my God. And he listened to my voice from his holy temple. And my cry in his presence entered into his ears.
\p
\v 8 The earth was shaken, and it trembled. The foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and they were shaken, because he was angry with them.
\p
\v 9 A smoke ascended by his wrath, and a fire flared up from his face: coals were kindled by it.
\p
\v 10 He bent the heavens, and they descended. And darkness was under his feet.
\p
\v 11 And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew: he flew upon the feathers of the winds.
\p
\v 12 And he set darkness as his hiding place, with his tabernacle all around him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.
\p
\v 13 At the brightness that was before his sight, the clouds crossed by, with hail and coals of fire.
\p
\v 14 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice: hail and coals of fire.
\p
\v 15 And he sent forth his arrows and scattered them. He multiplied lightnings, and he set them in disarray.
\p
\v 16 Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were revealed, by your rebuke, O Lord, by the inspiration of the Spirit of your wrath.
\p
\v 17 He sent from on high, and he accepted me. And he took me up, out of many waters.
\p
\v 18 He rescued me from my strongest enemies, and from those who hated me. For they had been too strong for me.
\p
\v 19 They intercepted me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord became my protector.
\p
\v 20 And he led me out, into a wide place. He accomplished my salvation, because he willed me.\f + \fr 17:20 \ft The phrase ‘quoniam voluit me’ could be translated as ‘because he was pleased with me,’ or ‘because he wanted me,’ or ‘because he willed me.’ In terms of salvation theology, God does not save us because of us but because of Himself. Therefore, ‘because he willed me,’ is the better fit.\f*
\p
\v 21 And the Lord will reward me according to my justice, and he will repay me according to the purity of my hands.
\p
\v 22 For I have preserved the ways of the Lord, and I have not behaved impiously before my God.
\p
\v 23 For all his judgments are in my sight, and his justice, I have not pushed away from me.
\p
\v 24 And I will be immaculate together with him, and I will keep myself from my iniquity.
\p
\v 25 And the Lord will reward me according to my justice and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes.

\v 32 For who is God, except the Lord? And who is God, except our God?
\p
\v 33 It is God who has wrapped me with virtue and made my way immaculate.

And your discipline itself will teach me.\f + \fr 17:36 \ft In most cases, ‘in finem’ means ‘in the end.’ In this context, perhaps the alternate translation of ‘in parts,’ also works. God does not wait until the end to correct, but He corrects in parts or in steps.\f*
\p

\p
\v 41 And you have given the back of my enemies to me, and you have destroyed those who hated me.\f + \fr 17:41 \ft The word ‘dorsum’ can also refer to a downhill position (i.e. the less favorable position during a battle).\f*
\p
\v 42 They cried out, but there was none to save them, to the Lord, but he did not heed them.
\p
\v 43 And I will crush them into dust before the face of the wind, so that I will obliterate them like the mud in the streets.
\p
\v 44 You will rescue me from the contradictions of the people. You will set me at the head of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 45 A people I did not know has served me. As soon as their ears heard, they were obedient to me.

\v 48 O God, who vindicates me and who subdues the people under me, my liberator from my enraged enemies.
\p
\v 49 And you will exalt me above those who rise up against me. From the iniquitous man, you will rescue me.\f + \fr 17:49 \ft Notice that the phrase ‘viro iniquo’ is translated using the word ‘man,’ but the word ‘iniquo’ by itself would be translated without the word ‘man.’\f*
\p
\v 50 Because of this, O Lord, I will confess to you among the nations, and I will compose a psalm to your name:\f + \fr 17:50 \ft The phrase ‘dicam psalmum’ can be translated as ‘I will recite a psalm,’ but such a translation would too weak for this context. The context is that of being vindicated and liberated from great harm, and of confessing to God among the nations of the world. Therefore, the phrase does not mean to merely recite a psalm, but to compose a psalm. (Composition in ancient times was probably most often done in spoken words, since most persons were illiterate and those who were literate did much less reading and writing than the average person today.)\f*

\v 4 For you have gone ahead of him with blessings of sweetness. You have placed a crown of precious stones on his head.
\p
\v 5 He petitioned you for life, and you have granted him length of days, in the present time, and forever and ever.\f + \fr 20:5 \ft This expression ‘in sæculum, et in sæculum sæculi’ refers both to the here and now on earth, and to eternity. So his prayer for long life is answered by a long life on earth in his own generation (in sæculum), and in eternity (in sæculum sæculi).\f*

The text is not merely saying that he is given blessings, but that he is given as a blessing. The one given as a blessing is Christ, foreshadowed by David.\f*

The second part of the verse uses ‘vultum’ to refer to the expression on their faces after God punishes them, i.e. to the effect of the punishment.\f*

\v 22 Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast.\f + \fr 21:22 \ft The word ‘unicornium’ does not refer to the mythical horse with a single horn. It refers literally to some type of wild animal with one horn in ancient times. This animal is most likely some species that has since gone extinct. Some have speculated that it could refer to the rhinoceros of India (Rhinoceros unicornis), which has one horn, unlike its African cousin, which has two horns. It also has a figurative meaning. Notice that the first part of the verse refers to being saved by lions. It is not the case that the Israelites were largely afraid of being eaten by lions; rather, the lion is figurative for a king or for governmental authority. Save me from governmental authority gone astray. Likewise, save my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast. This beast could represent law enforcement and military bodies gone astray. Guns and tanks can be figuratively said to have a single horn, yet they shoot many horns (bullets, etc.) from their single horn. May I be humble in the face of law enforcement and military authorities gone astray.\f*\f + \fr 21:22 \ft The single-horned beast can also be said to be a figure of the Antichrist’s kingdom. The figure of a horn is often used in the Old Testament to signify a leader of a kingdom. The Antichrist’s kingdom has a single horn, in the sense that he is one leader who will have dominion over nearly the whole world. And it has many horns, in that there are many other leaders who exercise authority under the Antichrist.\f*

\v 1 A Psalm of David, before he was sealed.
\p The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?\f + \fr 26:1 \ft Or, ‘before he was anointed.’ David is similar in many respects to the great monarch, who will receive the visible seal of God on his forehead, prior to beginning his reign as king of that vast territory formerly occupied by the Arab nations (led by Iraq and Iran).\f*
\p
\v 2 Meanwhile, the guilty draw near to me, so as to eat my flesh. Those who trouble me, my enemies, have themselves been weakened and have fallen.
\p
\v 3 If entrenched armies were to stand together against me, my heart would not fear. If a battle were to rise up against me, I would have hope in this.
\p
\v 4 One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, so that I may behold the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.
\p
\v 5 For he has hidden me in his tabernacle. In the day of evils, he has protected me in the hidden place of his tabernacle.\f + \fr 26:5 \ft During the latter half of the Antichrist’s reign (3.5 years), a part of the Church will be hidden from the world in a secret place.\f*
\p
\v 6 He has exalted me upon the rock, and now he has exalted my head above my enemies. I have circled around and offered a sacrifice of loud exclamation in his tabernacle. I will sing, and I will compose a psalm, to the Lord.\f + \fr 26:6 \ft The word ‘vociferationis’ does not refer specifically to jubilation, but to a loud, even disruptive outcry, either of protest or of gladness. The Rock upon which he is exalted is the Church. This psalm is about David, who composed psalms to the Lord; therefore, the translation ‘compose a psalm’ is more fitting than merely ‘recite a psalm.’ Also, the word psalm is singular here. If the meaning were merely to recite rather than to compose, then the word psalm would likely be plural.\f*
\p
\v 7 Hear my voice, O Lord, with which I have cried out to you. Have mercy on me, and hear me.
\p
\v 8 My heart has spoken to you; my face has sought you. I yearn for your face, O Lord.
\p
\v 9 Do not turn your face away from me. In your wrath, do not turn aside from your servant. Be my helper. Do not abandon me, and do not despise me, O God, my Savior.
\p
\v 10 For my father and my mother have left me behind, but the Lord has taken me up.
\p
\v 11 O Lord, establish a law for me in your way, and direct me in the right path, because of my enemies.
\p
\v 12 Do not surrender me to the souls of those who trouble me. For unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and iniquity has lied to itself.

\v 14 Wait for the Lord, act manfully; and let your heart be strengthened, and remain with the Lord.\f + \fr 26:14 \ft Most translations obscure this male reference (‘viriliter’), or drop the phrase entirely. “... and if anyone takes away from the words in this prophetic book, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city described in this book.” (Rev 22:19).

\v 1 The understanding of David himself.
\p Blessed are they whose iniquities have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered.\f + \fr 31:1 \ft Or, “The understanding of David to himself.” Or, “David’s own understanding.” This phrase has been often misunderstood. The word ‘intellectus’ is nominative, so it is the subject. The name David, and other non-Latin names written in Latin, often do not change their ending, despite being in various cases in various sentences. The word ‘David’ in this sentence is genitive (the understanding of David, or, David’s understanding). The word ‘ipsi’ is dative (to himself), but in English we would express this idea not by saying ‘The understanding of David to himself,’ but by saying, ‘The understanding of David himself.’ In other words, this psalm is about David’s own understanding. It is a psalm that describes things from David’s point of view.\f*
\p
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

\v 4 For, day and night, your hand was heavy upon me. I have been converted in my anguish, while still the thorn is piercing.
\p
\v 5 I have acknowledged my offense to you, and I have not concealed my injustice. I said, “I will confess against myself, my injustice to the Lord,” and you forgave the impiety of my sin.

\v 6 For this, everyone who is holy will pray to you in due time. Yet truly, in a flood of many waters, they will not draw near to him.\f + \fr 31:6 \ft A flood immediately precedes the reign of the Antichrist over the world.

\v 13 But the Lord will laugh at him: for he knows in advance that his day will come.
\p
\v 14 The sinners have drawn the sword, they have bent their bow, so as to cast down the poor and the needy, so as to massacre the upright of heart.
\p
\v 15 Let their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken.
\p
\v 16 A little is better to the just than the many riches of sinners.
\p
\v 17 For the arms of sinners will be crushed, but the Lord confirms the just.
\p
\v 18 The Lord knows the days of the immaculate, and their inheritance will be in eternity.
\p
\v 19 They will not be confounded in an evil time; and in days of famine, they will be satisfied:
\p
\v 20 for sinners will perish. Truly, the adversaries of the Lord, soon after they have been honored and exalted, will fade away, in the same way that smoke fades away.
\p
\v 21 The sinner will lend and not release, but the just one shows compassion and donates.\f + \fr 36:21 \ft Or, ‘The sinner borrows and does not repay.’ The words ‘Mutuabitur’ and ‘solvet’ seem to indicate lending and releasing from debit. But based on the meaning of the remainder of the sentence, other translators have translated the text as ‘borrow’ and ‘repay.’\f*
\p
\v 22 For those who bless him will inherit the earth, but those who curse him will perish.
\p
\v 23 The steps of a man will be directed by the Lord, and he will choose his way.
\p
\v 24 When he falls, he will not be harmed, because the Lord places his hand under him.
\p
\v 25 I have been young, and now I am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his offspring seeking bread.
\p
\v 26 He shows compassion and lends, all day long, and his offspring will be in blessing.\f + \fr 36:26 \ft The word ‘miseretur’ refers to showing mercy, or compassion, or pity for someone.\f*
\p
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do good, and dwell forever and ever.
\p
\v 28 For the Lord loves judgment, and he will not abandon his saints. They will be kept safe in eternity. The unjust will be punished, and the offspring of the impious will perish.\f + \fr 36:28 \ft The phrase ‘offspring of,’ or ‘sons of,’ is a figure of speech often used in the Old Testament. It does not literally mean that a child will perish if his parents sin. It means that if you sin continually, you are acting as if you were the offspring of sin. Thus, ‘semen impiorum peribit’ could be translated as ‘the offspring of impiety will perish.’ In another example, the ‘sons of adultery’ are not the biological sons of adulterers, but they are those who act as if they had adultery itself as a parent. This figure of speech is predicated on the idea that children learn most from their parents. If you commit adultery, it is as if your parents were adulterers, or as if your parent was adultery itself.\f*
\p
\v 29 But the just will inherit the earth, and they will dwell upon it forever and ever.
\p
\v 30 The mouth of the just one will express wisdom, and his tongue will speak judgment.
\p
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted.
\p
\v 32 The sinner considers the just one and seeks to put him to death.
\p
\v 33 But the Lord will not abandon him into his hands, nor condemn him, when he will be judged.
\p
\v 34 Wait for the Lord, and keep to his way. And he will exalt you, so as to inherit the land that you may seize. When the sinners will have passed away, then you shall see.\f + \fr 36:34 \ft The word ‘capias’ is in the Clementine Vulgate, but it’s translation is not found in the Wycliffe, Douay, or Challoner versions. The word ‘capias’ refers to the land that the just ‘seize’ when the sinners pass away.\f*
\p
\v 35 I have seen the impious over-exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon.
\p
\v 36 And I passed by, and behold, he was not. And I sought him, and his place was not found.
\p
\v 37 Keep to innocence, and gaze upon fairness: because there are allotments for the peaceful man.\f + \fr 36:37 \ft In this context, the word ‘reliquiae’ could be accurately translated as ‘bequests,’ or ‘bestowals,’ or ‘bequeathments,’ or ‘endowments,’ or ‘allotments.’\f*
\p
\v 38 But the unjust will be destroyed together: the allotments of the impious will pass away.\f + \fr 36:38 \ft The word ‘interibunt’ literally means ‘they will go between.’ This was an expression used to refer to going between this life and the next, i.e. passing away or crossing over. People still sometimes say that someone has ‘passed between the veil of this life and the next.’\f*
\p
\v 39 But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in time of tribulation.
\p
\v 40 And the Lord will help them and free them. And he will rescue them from sinners and save them, because they have hoped in him.

\p
\v 3 For your arrows have been driven into me, and your hand has been confirmed over me.
\p
\v 4 There is no health in my flesh before the face of your wrath. There is no peace for my bones before the face of my sins.
\p
\v 5 For my iniquities have walked over my head, and they have been like a heavy burden weighing upon me.
\p
\v 6 My sores have putrefied and been corrupted before the face of my foolishness.
\p
\v 7 I have become miserable, and I have been bent down, even to the end. I have walked with contrition all day long.
\p
\v 8 For my loins have been filled with illusions, and there is no health in my flesh.
\p
\v 9 I have been afflicted and greatly humbled. I bellowed from the groaning of my heart.
\p
\v 10 O Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning before you has not been hidden.
\p
\v 11 My heart has been disturbed. My strength has abandoned me, and the light of my eyes has abandoned me, and it is not with me.\f + \fr 37:11 \ft The verb for ‘lumen oculorum meorum’ is the same as the verb for the previous phrase, ‘dereliquit me virtus mea.’ This grammatical arrangement is common in Biblical Latin. The word ‘ipsum’ is nominative singular neuter, just as lumen is nominative singular neuter; therefore, ipsum refers to ‘lumen.’\f*
\p
\v 12 My friends and my neighbors have drawn near and stood against me. And those who were next to me stood far apart. And those who sought my soul used violence.
\p
\v 13 And those who sought evil accusations against me were speaking emptiness. And they practiced deceitfulness all day long.
\p
\v 14 But, like someone deaf, I did not hear. And I was like someone mute, not opening his mouth.
\p
\v 15 And I became like a man who does not hear, and who has no reproofs in his mouth.
\p
\v 16 For in you, Lord, I have hoped. You will listen to me, O Lord my God.
\p
\v 17 For I said, “Lest at any time, my enemies might rejoice over me,” and, “While my feet are being shaken, they have spoken great things against me.”
\p
\v 18 For I have been prepared for scourges, and my sorrow is ever before me.
\p
\v 19 For I will announce my iniquity, and I will think about my sin.
\p
\v 20 But my enemies live, and they have been stronger than me. And those who have wrongfully hated me have been multiplied.

\p
\v 3 I was silenced and humbled, and I was quiet before good things, and my sorrow was renewed.
\p
\v 4 My heart grew hot within me, and, during my meditation, a fire would flare up.
\p
\v 5 I spoke with my tongue, “O Lord, make me know my end, and what the number of my days will be, so that I may know what is lacking to me.”
\p
\v 6 Behold, you have made my days measurable, and, before you, my substance is as nothing. Yet truly, all things are vanity: every living man.
\p
\v 7 So then, truly man passes by like an image; even so, he is disquieted in vain. He stores up, and he knows not for whom he will gather these things.
\p
\v 8 And now, what is it that awaits me? Is it not the Lord? And my substance is with you.
\p
\v 9 Rescue me from all my iniquities. You have handed me over as a reproach to the foolish.

\v 10 I was silenced, and I did not open my mouth, because it was you who acted.
\p
\v 11 Remove your scourges from me.
\p
\v 12 I fall short at corrections from the strength of your hand. For you have chastised man for iniquity. And you have made his soul shrink away like a spider. Nevertheless, it is in vain that any man be disquieted.
\p
\v 13 O Lord, heed my prayer and my supplication. Pay attention to my tears. Do not be silent. For I am a newcomer with you, and a sojourner, just as all my fathers were.

\v 13 And the daughters of Tyre will entreat your countenance with gifts: all the rich men of the people.\f + \fr 44:13 \ft The word ‘filiæ’ is clearly feminine plural: ‘And the daughters of Tyre.’ Tyre was a wealthy city due to its prosperous dye (Tyrian purple) and clothier industry in Biblical times. However, ‘divites’ is clearly masculine plural: ‘all the rich men of the people.’ Ordinarily, a translator ought to prefer to translate one noun with one noun, but English does not allow one to indicate gender, even with many words that refer to people, such as ‘the rich’ or ‘the wealthy.’ Since the first part of the verse is clearly referring to the women of wealthy Tyre, the last part is also specifically meant to indicate the successful wealthy men among the people (not merely any or all of the people. Keeping the gender references intact in this verse is essential to understanding its meaning.\f*

\v 2 All nations, clap your hands. Shout joyfully to God with a voice of exultation.\f + \fr 46:2 \ft Or, ‘all Gentiles,’ or, ‘all unbelievers.’\f*
\p
\v 3 For the Lord is exalted and terrible: a great King over all the earth.
\p
\v 4 He has subjected the peoples to us and subdued the nations under our feet.
\p
\v 5 He has chosen us for his inheritance: the splendor of Jacob, whom he has loved.
\p
\v 6 God ascends with jubilation, and the Lord with the voice of the trumpet.
\p
\v 7 Sing psalms to our God, sing psalms. Sing psalms to our King, sing psalms.
\p
\v 8 For God is the King of all the earth. Sing psalms wisely.
\p
\v 9 God will reign over the peoples. God sits upon his holy throne.
\p
\v 10 The leaders of the peoples have been gathered together by the God of Abraham. For the strong gods of the earth have been exceedingly exalted.

\v 1 A Canticle Psalm. To the sons of Korah, on the second Sabbath.\f + \fr 47:1 \ft The second Sabbath is the second of the seven Sabbaths after Passover, counting towards the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost). This verse calls to mind the mention of the second first Sabbath in the Gospel. The first Sabbath is the Sabbath during Passover (zero in the count of the seven weeks and seven Sabbaths leading up to the Feast of Weeks). The second first Sabbath is the first Sabbath after Passover (one in the same count).\f*
\p
\v 2 The Lord is great and exceedingly praiseworthy, in the city of our God, on his holy mountain.
\p
\v 3 Mount Zion is being founded with the exultation of the whole earth, on the north side, the city of the great king.
\p
\v 4 In her houses, God will be known, since he will support her.
\p
\v 5 For behold, the kings of the earth have been gathered together; they have convened as one.
\p
\v 6 Such did they see, and they were astonished: they were disturbed, they were moved.
\p
\v 7 Trembling took hold of them. In that place, their pains were that of a woman in labor.
\p
\v 8 With a vehement spirit, you will crush the ships of Tarshish.
\p
\v 9 As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God has founded it in eternity.
\p
\v 10 We have received your mercy, O God, in the midst of your temple.
\p
\v 11 According to your name, O God, so does your praise reach to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of justice.
\p
\v 12 Let mount Zion rejoice, and let the daughters of Judah exult, because of your judgments, O Lord.
\p
\v 13 Encircle Zion and embrace her. Discourse in her towers.
\p
\v 14 Set your hearts on her virtue. And distribute her houses, so that you may discourse of it in another generation.
\p
\v 15 For this is God, our God, in eternity and forever and ever. He will rule us forever.

\v 1 Unto the end. A Psalm to the sons of Korah.
\p
\v 2 Hear these things, all nations. Pay attention, all inhabitants of the world:
\p
\v 3 whoever is earth-born, you sons of men, together as one, the rich and the poor.
\p
\v 4 My mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will speak prudence.
\p
\v 5 I will incline my ear to a parable. I will open my case with the psaltery.\f + \fr 48:5 \ft Although the word ‘psalterio’ refers to an ancient stringed musical instrument, it brings to mind the Psalter (the Psalms), and our Lady’s Psalter (the Rosary).\f*
\p
\v 6 Why should I fear in the evil day? The iniquity at my heel will surround me.
\p
\v 7 Those who trust in their own strength and who glory in the multitude of their riches,
\p
\v 8 no brother redeems, nor will man buy back. He will not give to God his appeasement,
\p
\v 9 nor the price for the redemption of his soul. And he will labor continuously,
\p
\v 10 and he will still live, until the end.
\p
\v 11 He will not see death, when he sees the wise dying: the foolish and the senseless will perish together. And they will leave their riches to strangers.
\p
\v 12 And their sepulchers will be their houses forever, their tabernacles from generation to generation. They have called their names in their own lands.\f + \fr 48:12 \ft In this last part, ‘nomina sua’ is accusative, not nominative. They (the sepulchers) have called their names in their own lands. In other words, their deaths and their final resting place is calling for them.\f*
\p
\v 13 And man, when he was held in honor, did not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them.
\p
\v 14 This way of theirs is a scandal to them. And afterwards, they will delight in their mouth.
\p
\v 15 They have been placed in Hell like sheep. Death will feed on them. And the just will have dominion over them in the morning. And their help will grow old in Hell for their glory.
\p
\v 16 Even so, truly God will redeem my soul from the hand of Hell, when he will receive me.
\p
\v 17 Do not be afraid, when a man will have been made rich, and when the glory of his house will have been multiplied.
\p
\v 18 For when he dies, he will take nothing away, and his glory will not descend with him.
\p
\v 19 For his soul will be blessed in his lifetime, and he will admit to you when you do good to him.
\p
\v 20 He will even enter with the progeny of his fathers, but, even in eternity, he will not see the light.
\p
\v 21 Man, when he was in honor, did not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them.

\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord has spoken, and he has called the earth, from the rising of the sun even to its setting,
\p

\p
\v 3 God will arrive manifestly. Our God also will not keep silence. A fire will flare up in his sight, and a mighty tempest will surround him.
\p
\v 4 He will call to heaven from above, and to the earth, to discern his people.
\p
\v 5 Gather his holy ones to him, you who order his covenant above sacrifices.
\p
\v 6 And the heavens will announce his justice. For God is the judge.
\p
\v 7 Listen, my people, and I will speak. Listen, Israel, and I will testify for you. I am God, your God.
\p
\v 8 I will not reprove you for your sacrifices. Moreover, your holocausts are ever in my sight.
\p
\v 9 I will not accept calves from your house, nor he-goats from your flocks.
\p
\v 10 For all the wild beasts of the forest are mine: the cattle on the hills and the oxen.
\p
\v 11 I know all the flying things of the air, and the beauty of the field is with me.
\p
\v 12 If I should be hungry, I would not tell you: for the whole world is mine, and all its plentitude.
\p
\v 13 Shall I gnaw on the flesh of bulls? Or would I drink the blood of goats?
\p
\v 14 Offer to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High.
\p
\v 15 And call upon me in the day of tribulation. I will rescue you, and you will honor me.
\p
\v 16 But to the sinner, God has said: Why do you discourse on my justices, and take up my covenant through your mouth?
\p
\v 17 Truly, you have hated discipline, and you have cast my sermons behind you.
\p
\v 18 If you saw a thief, you ran with him, and you have placed your portion with adulterers.\f + \fr 49:18 \ft Some take part in adultery and other sins, not by committing those acts themselves, but by supporting and encouraging those who do so.\f*
\p
\v 19 Your mouth has abounded with malice, and your tongue has concocted deceits.
\p
\v 20 Sitting, you spoke against your brother, and you set up a scandal against your mother’s son.
\p
\v 21 These things you have done, and I was silent. You thought, unjustly, that I ought to be like you. But I will reprove you, and I will set myself against your face.
\p
\v 22 Understand these things, you who forget God; lest at any time, he might quickly take you away, and there would be no one to rescue you.
\p
\v 23 The sacrifice of praise will honor me. And in that place is the journey by which I will reveal to him the salvation of God.

\v 1 Unto the end. A Psalm of David,
\v 2 when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he went to Bathsheba.
\p
\v 3 Be merciful to me, O God, according to your great mercy. And, according to the plentitude of your compassion, wipe out my iniquity.
\p
\v 4 Wash me once again from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
\p
\v 5 For I know my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.
\p
\v 6 Against you only have I sinned, and I have done evil before your eyes. And so, you are justified in your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment.
\p
\v 7 For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sinfulness did my mother conceive me.
\p
\v 8 For behold, you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your wisdom, you have manifested to me.
\p
\v 9 You will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed. You will wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow.
\p
\v 10 In my hearing, you will grant gladness and rejoicing. And the bones that have been humbled will exult.
\p
\v 11 Turn your face away from my sins, and erase all my iniquities.
\p
\v 12 Create a clean heart in me, O God. And renew an upright spirit within my inmost being.
\p
\v 13 Do not cast me away from your face; and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.\f + \fr 50:13 \ft The words ‘Spiritum Sanctum’ have been capitalized, and are translated as ‘Holy Spirit’ because this translation takes the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church. The Old Testament is therefore seen in the light of the New Testament and of the teachings of the Church.\f*
\p
\v 14 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and confirm me with an unsurpassed spirit.
\p
\v 15 I will teach the unjust your ways, and the impious will be converted to you.
\p
\v 16 Free me from blood, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will extol your justice.
\p
\v 17 O Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will announce your praise.
\p
\v 18 For if you had desired sacrifice, I would certainly have given it, but with holocausts, you will not be delighted.
\p
\v 19 A crushed spirit is a sacrifice to God. A contrite and humbled heart, O God, you will not spurn.
\p
\v 20 Act kindly, Lord, in your good will toward Zion, so that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.

\v 2 When Doeg the Edomite came and reported to Saul, David went to the house of Ahimelech.
\p
\v 3 Why do you glory in malice, you who are powerful in iniquity?
\p
\v 4 All day long your tongue thinks up injustice. Like a sharp razor, you have wrought deceit.
\p
\v 5 You have loved malice above goodness, and iniquity more than speaking righteousness.
\p
\v 6 You have loved all precipitous words, you deceitful tongue.
\p
\v 7 Because of this, God will destroy you in the end. He will pull you up, and he will remove you from your tabernacle and your root from the land of the living.
\p
\v 8 The just will see and be afraid, and they will laugh over him, and say:
\p
\v 9 “Behold the man who did not set God as his helper. But he hoped in the multitude of his riches, and so he prevailed in his emptiness.”
\p
\v 10 But I, like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God unto eternity, and forever and ever.

\p
\v 3 God gazed down from heaven on the sons of men, to see if there were any who were considering or seeking God.
\p
\v 4 All have gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.
\p
\v 5 Will they never learn: all those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal of bread?
\p
\v 6 They have not called upon God. In that place, they have trembled in fear, where there was no fear. For God has scattered the bones of those who please men. They have been confounded, because God has spurned them.

\v 2 Listen to my prayer, O God, and despise not my supplication.
\p
\v 3 Be attentive to me, and heed me. I have been grieved in my training, and I have been disturbed
\p
\v 4 at the voice of the adversary and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have diverted iniquities toward me, and they have been harassing me with rage.
\p
\v 5 My heart has become disturbed within me, and the dread of death has fallen over me.
\p
\v 6 Fear and trembling have overwhelmed me, and darkness has buried me.
\p
\v 7 And I said, “Who will give me wings like the dove, so that I may fly away and take rest?”
\p
\v 8 Behold, I have fled far away, and I linger in solitude.
\p
\v 9 I waited for him who saved me from a weak-minded spirit and from a tempest.\f + \fr 54:9 \ft The word ‘pusillanimitate’ is actually two Latin words put together. The first refers to a very young animal, but is used to express the idea of weakness. The second word refers to the mind, or soul, or spirit. The effect of putting the two words together results in an expression of the idea of a weak soul or a weak mind. Thus, ‘pusillanimitate spiritus’ refers to a weak-minded soul. The last word, ‘tempestate,’ in this context, refers not to a literal wind-storm, but to a tempest of the mind and soul, i.e. to inner turmoil. It can also be taken to refer to a storm of words or of various kinds of opposition to truth and justice.\f*
\p
\v 10 Cast them down, O Lord, and divide their tongues. For I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.
\p
\v 11 Day and night, iniquity will surround it upon its walls, and hardship is in its midst,
\p
\v 12 with injustice. And usury and deceit have not fallen away from its streets.
\p
\v 13 For if my enemy had spoken evil about me, certainly, I would have sustained it. And if he who hated me had been speaking great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.
\p
\v 14 Truly, you are a man of one mind: my leader and my acquaintance,
\p
\v 15 who took sweet food together with me. In the house of God, we walked side-by-side.\f + \fr 54:15 \ft The expression ‘ambulavimus cum consensu’ means to agree to walk together, much like the English expression, ‘we walked side-by-side.’\f*
\p
\v 16 Let death come upon them, and let them descend alive into Hellfire. For there is wickedness in their dwellings, in their midst.\f + \fr 54:16 \ft The Book of Revelation teaches that the Antichrist and the false prophet will be thrown alive into the fires of Hell. Those who are still alive on earth at the time of the general Resurrection, and who are unrepentant evil-doers, will also be sent alive into the fires of Hell, with a resurrected body and soul.\f*

\v 18 Evening and morning and midday, I will discourse and announce, and he will heed my voice.
\p
\v 19 He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near to me. For, among the many, they were with me.
\p
\v 20 God will hear, and He who is before time will humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God.
\p
\v 21 He has stretched forth his hand in retribution. They have contaminated his covenant.
\p
\v 22 They were divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart has drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and they are arrows.
\p
\v 23 Cast your cares upon the Lord, and he will nurture you. He will not allow the just to be tossed about forever.

Is not the one who wrote this psalm a composer of psalms? So then, his response would not be merely to recite a memorized psalm, but to compose one. Psalms were composed in ancient times, not so much by sitting down and writing, but by speaking the psalm first, and writing it later.\f*

\p
\v 4 Sinners have become foreigners from the womb; they have gone astray from conception. They have been speaking falsehoods.\f + \fr 57:4 \ft The word ‘vulva’ is feminine and refers to the womb or to the female’s generative capability. The word ‘utero’ is masculine and, in this context, refers to the male generative capability. It is not a second reference to the womb. Here the Scriptures are saying that the sinful tendencies of human persons comes from being conceived of fallen men and fallen women.\f*
\p

\v 9 Like wax that flows, they will be carried away. Fire has fallen upon them, and they will not see the sun.
\p
\v 10 Before your thorns could know the brier, he consumes them alive, as if in rage.\f + \fr 57:10 \ft The expression ‘absorbet eos viventes’ is figurative, as indicated by ‘sicut.’ However, it is already clear in the English translation that ‘swallowing them alive’ or ‘consuming them alive’ is a figure of speech, so a word-for-word translation of ‘sicut’ is not necessary. The meaning of ‘sicut’ is implied in the English text.\f*
\p
\v 11 The just one will rejoice when he sees vindication. He will wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.

\v 12 And man will say, “If the just one is fruitful, then, truly, there is a God judging them on earth.”\f + \fr 57:12 \ft Here the word ‘justo’ is singular, so it could be translated as ‘the just man,’ referring, on one level, to Christ. The teachings and sacrifice of Jesus Christ bear fruit, so man concludes that there is a God who judges the earth. But, on another level, the word ‘justo’ refers to the just in general, as indicated by the plural word ‘eos.’\f*

\p
\v 10 I will guard my strength toward you, for you are God, my supporter.\f + \fr 58:10 \ft The Douay-Rheims and Challoner Douay-Rheims lack the word ‘God’ in this verse, even though the Clementine Vulgate has the word God.

\p
\v 3 O God, you have rejected us, and you have ruined us. You became angry, and yet you have been merciful to us.
\p
\v 4 You have moved the earth, and you have disturbed it. Heal its breaches, for it has been moved.
\p
\v 5 You have revealed to your people difficulties. You have made us drink the wine of remorse.
\p
\v 6 You have given a warning sign to those who fear you, so that they may flee from before the face of the bow, so that your beloved may be delivered.
\p
\v 7 Save me with your right hand, and hear me.
\p
\v 8 God has spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will divide Shechem, and I will measure the steep valley of the tabernacles.
\p
\v 9 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the strength of my head. Judah is my king.
\p
\v 10 Moab is the cooking pot of my hope. Into Idumea, I will extend my shoe. To me, the foreigners have been made subject.
\p
\v 11 Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will lead me all the way to Idumea?
\p
\v 12 Will not you, O God, who has rejected us? And will not you, O God, go out with our armies?
\p
\v 13 Grant us help from tribulation. For salvation from man is empty.
\p
\v 14 In God, we will act virtuously. And those who trouble us, he will lead to nothing.

\p
\v 2 O God, pay attention to my supplication. Be attentive to my prayer.
\p
\v 3 I cried out to you from the ends of the earth. When my heart was in anguish, you exalted me on a rock. You have led me,
\p
\v 4 for you have been my hope, a tower of strength before the face of the enemy.
\p
\v 5 I will dwell in your tabernacle forever. I will be protected under the cover of your wings.
\p
\v 6 For you, my God, have listened to my prayer. You have granted an inheritance to those who fear your name.
\p
\v 7 You will add days to the days of the king, to his years, even to the time of generation after generation.
\p
\v 8 He remains in eternity, in the sight of God. Who will long for his mercy and truth?

\p
\v 2 Will my soul not be subject to God? For from him is my salvation.
\p
\v 3 Yes, he himself is my God and my salvation. He is my supporter; I will be moved no more.
\p
\v 4 How is it that you rush against a man? Every one of you puts to death, as if you were pulling down a ruined wall, leaning over and falling apart.\f + \fr 61:4 \ft The word ‘parieti’ refers to a ruined wall. The addition of the phrase ‘inclinato et maceriæ,’ further describes the wall as leaning over and falling apart. The word ‘maceriæ’ is often used to describe a garden wall, because garden walls have no mortar; they are simply one stone on another. Thus the word ‘maceriæ,’ in this context, refers to a wall that has lost its mortar and is therefore falling apart.\f*
\p
\v 5 So, truly, they intended to reject my price. I ran in thirst. They blessed with their mouth and cursed with their heart.
\p
\v 6 Yet, truly, my soul will be subject to God. For from him is my patience.
\p
\v 7 For he is my God and my Savior. He is my helper; I will not be expelled.
\p
\v 8 In God is my salvation and my glory. He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
\p
\v 9 All peoples gathered together: trust in him. Pour out your hearts in his sight. God is our helper for eternity.
\p
\v 10 So, truly, the sons of men are untrustworthy. The sons of men are liars in the scales, so that, by emptiness, they may deceive among themselves.
\p
\v 11 Do not trust in iniquity, and do not desire plunder. If riches flow toward you, do not be willing to set your heart on them.
\p
\v 12 God has spoken once. I have heard two things: that power belongs to God,
\p
\v 13 and that mercy belongs to you, O Lord. For you will repay each one according to his works.

\p
\v 3 By a deserted land, both inaccessible and waterless, so I have appeared in the sanctuary before you, in order to behold your virtue and your glory.
\p
\v 4 For your mercy is better than life itself. It is you my lips will praise.
\p
\v 5 So will I bless you in my life, and I will lift up my hands in your name.
\p
\v 6 Let my soul be filled, as if with marrow and fatness; and my mouth will give praise with exultant lips.
\p
\v 7 When I have remembered you on my bed in the morning, I will meditate on you.
\p
\v 8 For you have been my helper. And I will exult under the cover of your wings.
\p
\v 9 My soul has clung close to you. Your right hand has supported me.
\p
\v 10 Truly, these ones have sought my soul in vain. They will enter into the lower parts of the earth.
\p
\v 11 They will be delivered into the hand of the sword. They will be the portions of foxes.

\p
\v 3 You have protected me from the assembly of the malignant, from a multitude of workers of iniquity.
\p
\v 4 For they have sharpened their tongues like a sword; they have formed their bow into a bitter thing,
\p
\v 5 so that they may shoot arrows from hiding at the immaculate.
\p
\v 6 They will suddenly shoot arrows at him, and they will not be afraid. They are resolute in their wicked talk. They have discussed hidden snares. They have said, “Who will see them?”
\p
\v 7 They have been searching carefully for iniquities. Their exhaustive search has failed. Man will approach with a deep heart,\f + \fr 63:7 \ft The repetition in the phrase ‘defecerunt scrutantes scrutinio’ indicates intensity. It is best expressed by rephrasing the sentence so that the search is the subject: ‘their exhaustive search has failed,’ rather than ‘they have failed in their exhaustive search.’ The meaning is that the wicked have searched for iniquities so as to make an accusation against the just; but they fail to find any true accusation to make.\f*
\p
\v 8 and God will be exalted. The arrows of the little ones have become their wounds,
\p
\v 9 and their tongues have been weakened against them. All those who saw them have been troubled;
\p
\v 10 and every man was afraid. And they announced the works of God, and they understood his acts.

\p
\v 7 It is God who makes men dwell in a house under one custom. He leads out those who are strongly bound, and similarly, those who exasperate, who dwell in sepulchers.\f + \fr 67:7 \ft This verse refers to men who dwell together under one set of rules (as in a religious order), or under an agreed upon set of behaviors or morals. It indicates harmony, as opposed to conflict.\f*
\p
\v 8 O God, when you departed in the sight of your people, when you passed through the desert,

\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph.
\p How good is God to Israel, to those who are upright in heart.
\p
\v 2 But my feet were nearly moved; my steps had nearly slipped.
\p
\v 3 For I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the peacefulness of sinners.
\p
\v 4 For they have no respect for their death, nor do they have support in their wounds.
\p
\v 5 They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety.
\p
\v 7 Their iniquity has proceeded, as if from fat. They have parted from the affection of the heart.
\p
\v 8 They have thought and spoken wickedness. They have spoken iniquity in high places.\f + \fr 72:8 \ft In modern terms, speaking iniquity in high places could be equated to speaking iniquity in the media.\f*
\p
\v 9 They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has traversed the earth.\f + \fr 72:9 \ft Again, through the media, many persons speak against heaven and their words traverse the earth.\f*
\p
\v 10 Therefore, my people will be converted here, and fullness of days will be found in them.
\p
\v 11 And they said, “How would God know?” and, “Isn’t there knowledge in high places?”\f + \fr 72:11 \ft The word ‘excelso’ here does not refer to God Most High. Rather, it refers to the ‘excelso’ of the above verse, i.e. the high places of the world, such as governments and corporations and news media organizations, etc. The word ‘si’ is not simply translated as ‘if’ or ‘whether.’\f*
\p
\v 12 Behold, these are sinners, and, abounding in this age, they have obtained riches.
\p
\v 13 And I said: So then, it is without purpose that I have justified my heart and washed my hands among the innocent.
\p
\v 14 And I have been scourged all day long, and I have received my chastisement in the mornings.
\p
\v 15 If I were to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn this nation of your sons.
\p
\v 16 I considered, so that I might know this. It is a hardship before me,
\p
\v 17 until I may enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last part.
\p
\v 18 So, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you were casting them down.
\p
\v 19 How have they been brought to desolation? They have suddenly failed. They have perished because of their iniquity.
\p
\v 20 As a dream is to those who awaken, O Lord, so will you reduce their image to nothing in your city.
\p
\v 21 For my heart has been inflamed, and my temperament has been changed.
\p
\v 22 And so, I have been reduced to nothing, and I did not know it.
\p
\v 23 I have become like a beast of burden to you, and I am always with you.
\p
\v 24 You have held my right hand. And in your will, you have conducted me, and with your glory, you have taken me up.
\p
\v 25 For what is there for me in heaven? And what do I wish for on earth before you?
\p
\v 26 My body has failed, and my heart: O God of my heart, and God my portion, into eternity.

\v 27 For behold, those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have perished all those who fornicate away from you.

\p
\v 3 Lift up your hands against their arrogance in the end. How great the malice of the enemy has been in the sanctuary!\f + \fr 73:3 \ft This last part is literally: “How much the enemy has been malicious in the sanctuary!”\f*
\p
\v 4 And those who hate you have been glorified, in the midst of your solemnity. They have set up their own signs as a proof,
\p
\v 5 as if it had been issued from on high; yet they did not understand. As in a forest of chopped wood,\f + \fr 73:5 \ft They set up their own signs and then they use those signs as their proof. And they do not even understand that such signs are not valid because they come from themselves, but they consider such signs as if they had the validity of signs issued from on high (from God).\f*
\p
\v 6 they have cut down the entrances themselves. With axe and hatchet, they have brought it down.
\p
\v 7 They have set fire to your Sanctuary. They have polluted the tabernacle of your name on earth.
\p
\v 8 They have said in their heart, the whole group of them together: “Let us cause all the feast days of God to cease from the land.

\v 9 We have not seen our proof; there is now no prophet. And he will no longer know us.”

\v 10 How long, O God, will the enemy place blame? Is the adversary to provoke your name until the end?

\v 12 But God is our king before all ages. He has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
\p
\v 13 In your virtue, you confirmed the sea. You crushed the heads of the serpents in the waters.
\p
\v 14 You have broken the heads of the serpent. You have given him as food for the people of the Ethiopians.
\p
\v 15 You have disrupted the fountains and the torrents. You have dried up the rivers of Ethan.

\v 16 Yours is the day, and yours is the night. You have made the morning light and the sun.
\p
\v 17 You have made all the limits of the earth. The summer and the spring were formed by you.
\p
\v 18 Be mindful of this: the enemy placed blame against the Lord, and a foolish people has incited against your name.
\p
\v 19 Do not hand over to beasts the souls that confess to you; and do not forget the souls of your poor until the end.
\p
\v 20 Consider your covenant. For those who have been darkened upon the earth have been filled by the iniquity of the houses.

\p
\v 9 For, in the hand of the Lord, there is a cup of undiluted wine, full of consternation. And he has tipped it from here to there. So, truly, its dregs have not been emptied. All the sinners of the earth will drink.\f + \fr 74:9 \ft The expression ‘meri vini’ refers to undiluted wine. In ancient times, people often diluted their wine with water; this made the water more sanitary, while preventing drunkenness. This metaphorical wine is undiluted. God tips the cup of wine from one side to another (not pouring it out yet), so as to mix the sediments into the wine, making is full strength.

\v 2 I cried out to the Lord with my voice, to God with my voice, and he attended to me.
\p
\v 3 In the days of my tribulation, I sought God, with my hands opposite him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be consoled.
\p
\v 4 I was mindful of God, and I was delighted, and I was distressed, and my spirit fell away.\f + \fr 76:4 \ft This verse sums up the contemplative way. First, you consider God with your mind. Second, you find delight in God and receive light and consolation. Third, you encounter hardships, walking, as it were, a dark and rocky road to Calvary. This third step is called the dark night of the soul. Fourth, you arrive at a contemplation of God whereby your sense of self and all traces of self-interest fall away, leaving only God.\f*
\p
\v 5 My eyes anticipated the vigils. I was disturbed, and I did not speak.
\p
\v 6 I considered the days of antiquity, and I held the years of eternity in my mind.

Will he not continue to allow himself to show favor?\f + \fr 76:8 \ft The word ‘numquid’ indicates that the answer to the question is ‘no.’ Therefore, the phrasing of the question must also indicate that fact.

\v 3 We have heard and known such great things, as our fathers have described to us.
\p
\v 4 These things have not been hidden from their sons in any generation: declaring the praises of the Lord, and his virtues, and the wonders that he has done.
\p
\v 5 And he has received testimony with Jacob, and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to their sons,
\p
\v 6 so that another generation might know them, and so that the sons, who will be born and who will grow up, shall describe them to their sons.
\p
\v 7 So then, may they put their hope in God, and may they not forget the works of God, and may they seek his commandments.
\p
\v 8 May they not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation: a generation that does not straighten their heart and whose spirit is not trustworthy with God.
\p
\v 9 The sons of Ephraim, who bend and shoot the bow, have been turned back in the day of battle.
\p
\v 10 They have not kept the covenant of God. And they were not willing to walk in his law.

\v 11 And they have been forgetful of his benefits, and of his miracle, which he revealed to them.
\p
\v 12 He performed miracles in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.
\p
\v 13 He broke the sea and he led them through. And he stationed the waters, as if in a vessel.
\p
\v 14 And he led them with a cloud by day, and with illumination by fire throughout the night.
\p
\v 15 He broke through the rock in the wasteland, and he gave them to drink, as if from the great abyss.
\p
\v 16 He brought forth water from the rock, and he conducted the waters, as if they were rivers.
\p
\v 17 And yet, they continued to sin against him. In a waterless place, they provoked the Most High with resentment.\f + \fr 77:17 \ft They were angry and resentful that they were led to a waterless place by God.\f*
\p
\v 18 And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking for food according to their desires.
\p
\v 19 And they spoke badly about God. They said, “Would God be able to prepare a table in the desert?
\p
\v 20 He struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread, or provide a table, for his people?”
\p
\v 21 Therefore, the Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel.
\p
\v 22 For they neither put their trust in God, nor did they hope in his salvation.
\p
\v 23 And he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of heaven.
\p
\v 24 And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and he gave them the bread of heaven.
\p
\v 25 Man ate the bread of Angels. He sent them provisions in abundance.
\p
\v 26 He transferred the south wind from heaven, and, in his virtue, he brought in the Southwest wind.
\p
\v 27 And he rained down flesh upon them, as if it were dust, and feathered birds, as if they were the sand of the sea.
\p
\v 28 And they fell down in the midst of their camp, encircling their tabernacles.
\p
\v 29 And they ate until they were greatly satisfied, and he brought to them according to their desires.

\v 30 They were not cheated out of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth,

\v 31 and then the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of Israel.

\v 32 In all these things, they continued to sin, and they were not trustworthy with his miracles.
\p
\v 33 And their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste.

\p
\v 36 And they chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with their tongue.
\p
\v 37 For their heart was not upright with him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant.
\p
\v 38 Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely.
\p
\v 39 And he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit that goes forth and does not return.\f + \fr 77:39 \ft In the ancient view, man is body, spirit, and soul. The spirit of man is not a third part, but merely the quality of being alive, when body and soul are united. At death, body and soul are separated, and spirit (the breath of life) seems to cease to exist, but only because it is a quality, not a thing.\f*
\p
\v 40 How often did they provoke him in the desert and stir him to wrath in a waterless place?
\p
\v 41 And they turned back and tempted God, and they exasperated the Holy One of Israel.
\p
\v 42 They did not remember his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of the one troubling them.
\p
\v 43 Thus, he positioned his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Tanis.
\p
\v 44 And he turned their rivers into blood, along with their rain showers, so that they could not drink.
\p
\v 45 He sent among them the common fly, and it devoured them, and the frog, and it scattered them.

\v 46 And he gave up their fruits to mold and their labors to the locust.
\p
\v 47 And he slew their vineyards with hail and their mulberry trees with severe frost.

\v 49 And he sent the wrath of his indignation among them: indignation and wrath and tribulation, sent forth by evil angels.
\p
\v 50 He made way for the path of his anger. He did not spare their souls from death. And he enclosed their beasts of burden in death.
\p
\v 51 And he struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt: the first-fruits of all their labor in the tabernacles of Ham.
\p

Therefore, the word also indirectly refers to the Psalter, that is, to the psalms and particularly to the psalms when they are sung or chanted or accompanied by music. The less literal translation is more meaningful.\f*

\v 8 You called upon me in tribulation, and I freed you. I heard you within the hidden tempest. I tested you with waters of contradiction.
\p
\v 9 My people, listen and I will call you to testify. If, O Israel, you will pay heed to me,
\p
\v 10 then there will be no new god among you, nor will you adore a foreign god.

\v 11 For I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt. Widen your mouth, and I will fill it.
\p
\v 12 But my people did not hear my voice, and Israel was not attentive to me.
\p
\v 13 And so, I sent them away, according to the desires of their heart. They will go forth according to their own inventions.
\p
\v 14 If my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways,

\v 15 I would have humbled their enemies, as if it were nothing, and I would have sent my hand upon those who troubled them.\f + \fr 80:15 \ft Or, ‘perhaps for nothing, I would have humbled their enemies.’\f*

The other verses are numbered consecutively, totaling seven verses instead of five.\f*\f + \fr 92:1 \ft The word ‘die’ is translated as ‘time’ instead of ‘day’ because that is the meaning and because the use of day would be confusing since the creation of the world is metaphorically divided into 6 days. The 7th day was the first Sabbath, a day of rest.\f*

\v 2 The Lord has reigned. He has been clothed with beauty.
\p
\v 3 The Lord has been clothed with strength, and he has girded himself. Yet he has also confirmed the world, which will not be moved.

\v 5 The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods have lifted up their waves,

\p
\v 3 How long will sinners, O Lord, how long will sinners glory?
\p
\v 4 How long will they utter and speak iniquity? How long will all who work injustice speak out?\f + \fr 93:4 \ft The translation words ‘how long...’ are implied from the previous verse.\f*
\p
\v 5 They have humiliated your people, O Lord, and they have harassed your inheritance.
\p
\v 6 They have executed the widow and the new arrival, and they have slaughtered the orphan.
\p
\v 7 And they have said, “The Lord will not see, nor will the God of Jacob understand.”
\p
\v 8 Understand, you senseless ones among the people. And be wise at last, you foolish ones.

\v 11 The Lord knows the thoughts of men: that these are in vain.
\p
\v 12 Blessed is the man whom you will instruct, O Lord. And you will teach him from your law.

\v 13 So may you soothe him from the evil days, until a pit may be dug for sinners.
\p
\v 14 For the Lord will not drive away his people, and he will not abandon his inheritance,
\p
\v 15 even until the time when justice is being converted into judgment, and when those who are close to justice are all those who are upright of heart.\f + \fr 93:15 \ft The pronoun ‘illam’ is singular feminine, so it refers to ‘justitia’ not ‘judicium.’ The translation is somewhat loose in order to preserve the meaning of the Latin.\f*
\p
\v 16 Who will rise up with me against the malignant? Or who will stand with me against the workers of iniquity?
\p

\v 20 Does the seat of iniquity adhere to you, you who contrive hardship within a commandment?

He will judge the peoples with fairness.\f + \fr 95:10 \ft Even though the previous verse said that the entire earth could be shaken before the face of God, this verse says that the whole world will not be shaken (or moved). Presently, the earth can and will be shaken, but eventually God will establish His kingdom on earth and it shall never be shaken (or moved or destroyed) again.\f*
\p
\v 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult; let the sea and all its fullness be moved.

\cl Psalm 96 \ca (97)\ca*
\d
\v 1 This is to David, when his land was restored to him.
\p The Lord has reigned, let the earth exult. Let the many islands rejoice.\f + \fr 96:1 \ft The first two words are usually translated as ‘to this David,’ or ‘to the same David.’ The word ‘huic’ is dative, indicating an indirect object, which is often translated using the English ‘to’ or ‘for.’ Essentially, the first word, ‘huic’ translates as ‘for this,’ or ‘to this.’ The word ‘David’ (as with many non-Latin names) is not usually altered in its ending to indicate case. The translation could be ‘To this David,’ but then the word ‘this’ would not be of much use, except to indicate the case of the word ‘David,’ i.e. ‘To David,’ rather than ‘To this David.’ Another possible translation (a somewhat loose translation), would be to view ‘David’ as the subject: ‘David is for this,’ which can be rephrased in English as ‘This is for David.’\f*\f + \fr 96:1 \ft So the translation should be either: ‘To David,’ or, ‘This is for David.’ Both of which have approximately the same meaning.\f*
\p
\v 2 Clouds and mist are all around him. Justice and judgment are corrections from his throne.
\p
\v 3 A fire will precede him, and it will enflame his enemies all around.

\v 5 Sing psalms to the Lord with stringed instruments, with strings and the voice of a psalmist,\f + \fr 97:5 \ft The translation here is less strict, in order to take into account a wide range of musical instruments, rather than trying to convey the type of instruments used in ancient times.\f*
\p
\v 6 with subtle wind instruments and the voice of woodwinds. Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king.\f + \fr 97:6 \ft The ‘ductile’ tuba or trumpet, is not so much made of ductile metal, as it is metaphorically ductile, i.e. subtle and easily flowing in musical quality. The ‘tubæ corneæ’ refers to woodwinds because ‘tubae’ refers to any type of wind instrument, and ‘corneae’ refers to anything made from the wood of the cornel tree.\f*

\v 6 We have sinned, as have our fathers. We have acted unjustly; we have wrought iniquity.
\p
\v 7 Our fathers did not understand your miracles in Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of your mercies. And they provoked you, while going up to the sea, even the Red Sea.
\p
\v 8 And he saved them for the sake of his name, so that he might make known his power.

\v 9 And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up. And he led them into the abyss, as if into a desert.

\p
\v 23 And he said that he would destroy them, yet Moses, his elect, stood firm before him in the breach, in order to avert his wrath, lest he destroy them.
\p
\v 24 And they held the desirable land to be nothing. They did not trust in his word.
\p
\v 25 And they murmured in their tabernacles. They did not heed the voice of the Lord.
\p
\v 26 And he lifted up his hand over them, in order to prostrate them in the desert,

\p
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, about which the Lord had spoken to them.
\p
\v 35 And they were mixed among the Gentiles. And they learned their works,

\p
\v 37 And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
\p
\v 38 And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters, which they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan. And the land was infected with bloodshed,

\v 39 and was contaminated with their works. And they fornicated according to their own inventions.
\p
\v 40 And the Lord became furiously angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.

\p
\v 3 They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues, and they have surrounded me with hateful words, and they fought against me over nothing.
\p
\v 4 Instead of choosing to act on my behalf, they detracted me. But I gave myself to prayer.\f + \fr 108:4 \ft The verb ‘diligerent’ can mean ‘to love,’ but it can also mean ‘to choose.’ In this case, his complaint is not that they don’t love him, but that they do not choose (to act) on his behalf or in his favor.\f*
\p
\v 5 And they set evil against me, instead of good, and hatred, in return for my love.
\p
\v 6 Establish the sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand.

\p
\v 9 May his sons be orphans, and his wife a widow.
\p
\v 10 May his sons be carried by those who walk unsteadily, and may they go begging. And may they be cast out of their dwelling places.\f + \fr 108:10 \ft The word ‘Nutantes’ refers to wavering. In other words: may his sons be carried around by those who waver (walk unsteadily).\f*
\p
\v 11 May the money lenders scrutinize all his belongings, and let foreigners plunder his labors.
\p
\v 12 May there be no one to assist him, nor anyone to be compassionate to his orphaned children.
\p
\v 13 May his posterity be in utter ruin. In one generation, may his name be wiped away.
\p
\v 14 May the iniquity of his fathers return in memory before the sight of the Lord, and do not let the sin of his mother be wiped away.
\p
\v 15 May these be opposite the Lord always, but let their memory perish from the earth.
\p
\v 16 For certain things are not remembered about them, in order to be merciful.\f + \fr 108:16 \ft This verse is more accurately translated loosely. It explains the previous verses, which say that these evil doers will be forgotten through all the earth, but not by God. Their evil deeds will not be remembered for the sake of mercy. The subsequent verses detail some of those evil deeds.\f*
\p
\v 17 And so the destitute man was pursued, with the beggar and the remorseful in heart, so as to be put to death.
\p
\v 18 And he loved a curse, and it came to him. And he was unwilling to have a blessing, and it went far from him. And he clothed himself with curses like a garment, and it entered his inner self like water, and it entered his bones like oil.

\p
\v 3 It is with you from the beginning, in the day of your virtue, in the splendor of the saints. From conception, before the light-bearer, I begot you.\f + \fr 109:3 \ft The phrase ‘ante luciferum’ has a level of meaning whereby it refers to Lucifer, the devil. The meaning here is that God’s only Son was begotten in eternity, before the Angels were created, before the Angels fell from grace, before Lucifer (the light-bearer) became Satan (the adversary). The phrase ‘ex utero’ does not mean ‘from the womb,’ but has more of the meaning of ‘from conception.’ The word ‘utero’ is often used in Latin to refer to the generative capability (the ability to bring about conception) of men and women. In this case, it refers to the generative capability of the Father to give rise to the Son by procession.\f*

\p I have loved: therefore, the Lord will heed the voice of my prayer.\f + \fr 114:1 \ft In this case, ‘quoniam’ does not mean ‘because,’ but more like ‘therefore.’ Here is a common translation problem. A Latin word is very often translated, and properly so, by one particular English word. Then along comes a context in which that Latin word actually means something else. It should be translated in this other context by another English word. But it is a common translation mistake not to do so. In this verse, the statement ‘I have loved,’ is followed, not by the reason that I loved, but by the result of that choice. I do not choose to love because I think that God will answer my prayers, but rather when I choose to love, the result is that God will answer my prayers.\f*

\v 11 Surrounding me, they closed in on me. And, in the name of the Lord, I have been avenged over them.
\p
\v 12 They surrounded me like a swarm, and they burned like fire among the thorns. And, in the name of the Lord, I have been avenged over them.

\v 22 The stone which the builders have rejected, this has become the head of the corner.\f + \fr 117:22 \ft The Latin phrase translated as ‘head of the corner’ is a Latin translation of the same Hebrew expression.

\v 27 The Lord is God, and he has enlightened us. Establish a solemn day amid a dense crowd, even to the horn of the altar.\f + \fr 117:27 \ft The word ‘condensis’ often refers to a dense thicket of woods. However, in this context (of something dense like a thicket of trees that reaches even to the altar) the meaning is clearly of a thick crowd attending a solemn ceremony.\f*
\p
\v 28 You are my God, and I will confess to you. You are my God, and I will exalt you. I will confess to you, for you have heeded me. And you have become my salvation.

\p I will extol you, O God, my king. And I will bless your name, in this time and forever and ever.
\p
\v 2 Throughout every single day, I will bless you. And I will praise your name, in this time and forever and ever.
\p
\v 3 The Lord is great and exceedingly praiseworthy. And there is no end to his greatness.
\p
\v 4 Generation after generation will praise your works, and they will declare your power.
\p
\v 5 They will tell of the magnificent glory of your sanctity. And they will discourse of your wonders.
\p
\v 6 And they will talk about the virtue of your terrible acts. And they will describe your greatness.
\p
\v 7 They will shout about the memory of your abundant sweetness. And they will exult in your justice.
\p
\v 8 The Lord is compassionate and merciful, patient and full of mercy.
\p
\v 9 The Lord is sweet to all things, and his compassion is upon all his works.
\p
\v 10 O Lord, may all your works confess to you, and let your holy ones bless you.
\p
\v 11 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and they will declare your power,
\p
\v 12 so as to make known to the sons of men your power and the glory of your magnificent kingdom.
\p
\v 13 Your kingdom is a kingdom for all ages, and your dominion is with all, from generation to generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words and holy in all his works.
\p
\v 14 The Lord lifts up all who have fallen down, and he sets upright all who have been thrown down.
\p
\v 15 O Lord, all eyes hope in you, and you provide their food in due time.
\p
\v 16 You open your hand, and you fill every kind of animal with a blessing.
\p
\v 17 The Lord is just in all his ways and holy in all his works.
\p
\v 18 The Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth.
\p
\v 19 He will do the will of those who fear him, and he will heed their supplication and accomplish their salvation.
\p
\v 20 The Lord watches over all who love him. And he will destroy all sinners.
\p
\v 21 My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord, and may all flesh bless his holy name, in this time and forever and ever.
\c 145
\cl Psalm 145 \ca (146)\ca*
\d
\v 1 Alleluia. Of Haggai and Zachariah.
\p
\v 2 Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord with my life. I will sing psalms to my God as long as I shall be. Do not trust in the leaders,\f + \fr 145:2 \ft The phrase ‘in vita mea’ could be translated as ‘in my life’ or ‘with my life.’ Adding ‘in my life’ to ‘I will praise the Lord’ adds little meaning. Whenever you praise God, it occurs during your life. However, the phrase ‘with my life’ adds significant meaning to the phase ‘I will praise the Lord,’ because it indicates that the praise is not merely with words, nor even with a few deeds, but that one’s entire life becomes a way of praising God.\f*
\p
\v 3 in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.
\p
\v 4 His spirit will depart, and he will return to his earth. In that day, all their thoughts will perish.
\p
\v 5 Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob: his hope is in the Lord God himself,
\p
\v 6 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all the things that are in them.
\p
\v 7 He preserves the truth forever. He executes judgment for those who suffer injury. He provides food for the hungry. The Lord releases those who are bound.
\p
\v 8 The Lord enlightens the blind. The Lord sets upright those who have been thrown down. The Lord loves the just.
\p
\v 9 The Lord watches over new arrivals. He will support the orphan and the widow. And he will destroy the ways of sinners.
\p
\v 10 The Lord shall reign forever: your God, O Zion, from generation to generation.
\c 146
\cl Psalm 146 (147A)
\d
\v 1 Alleluia.
\p Praise the Lord, because the psalm is good. Delightful and beautiful praise shall be for our God.
\p
\v 2 The Lord builds up Jerusalem. He will gather together the dispersed of Israel.
\p
\v 3 He heals the contrite of heart, and he binds up their sorrows.
\p
\v 4 He numbers the multitude of the stars, and he calls them all by their names.
\p
\v 5 Great is our Lord, and great is his virtue. And of his wisdom, there is no number.
\p
\v 6 The Lord lifts up the meek, but he brings down the sinner, even to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Sing before the Lord with confession. Play psalms to our God on a stringed instrument.
\p
\v 8 He covers heaven with clouds, and he prepares rain for the earth. He produces grass on the mountains and herbs for the service of men.
\p
\v 9 He gives their food to beasts of burden and to young ravens that call upon him.
\p
\v 10 He will not have good will for the strength of the horse, nor will he be well pleased with the legs of a man.
\p
\v 11 The Lord is well pleased with those who fear him and with those who hope in his mercy.
\c 147
\cl Psalm 147 (147B)
\d
\v 1 Alleluia.
\p Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion.
\p
\v 2 For he has reinforced the bars of your gates. He has blessed your sons within you.
\p
\v 3 He has stationed peace at your borders, and he has satisfied you with the fat of the grain.
\p
\v 4 He sends forth his eloquence to the earth. His word runs swiftly.
\p
\v 5 He provides snow like wool. He strews clouds like ashes.
\p
\v 6 He sends his ice crystals like morsels. Who can stand firm before the face of his cold?
\p
\v 7 He will send forth his word, and it will melt them. His Spirit will breathe out, and the waters will flow.\f + \fr 147:7 \ft Or, more literally, ‘His wind will blow and the waters will flow.’ The translation of ‘His Spirit will breathe’ clarifies and emphasizes the spiritual meaning of the text.\f*
\p
\v 8 He announces his word to Jacob, his justices and his judgments to Israel.
\p
\v 9 He has not done so much for every nation, and he has not made his judgments manifest to them. Alleluia.
\c 148
\cl Psalm 148
\d
\v 1 Alleluia.
\p Praise the Lord from the heavens. Praise him on the heights.
\p
\v 2 Praise him, all his Angels. Praise him, all his hosts.
\p
\v 3 Praise him, sun and moon. Praise him, all stars and light.
\p
\v 4 Praise him, heavens of the heavens. And let all the waters that are above the heavens
\p
\v 5 praise the name of the Lord. For he spoke, and they became. He commanded, and they were created.
\p
\v 6 He has stationed them in eternity, and for age after age. He has established a precept, and it will not pass away.
\p
\v 7 Praise the Lord from the earth: you dragons and all deep places,
\p
\v 8 fire, hail, snow, ice, windstorms, which do his word,
\p
\v 9 mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
\p
\v 10 wild beasts and all cattle, serpents and feathered flying things,
\p
\v 11 kings of the earth and all peoples, leaders and all judges of the earth,
\p
\v 12 young men and virgins. Let the older men with the younger men, praise the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 For his name alone is exalted.
\p
\v 14 Confession of him is beyond heaven and earth, and he has exalted the horn of his people. A hymn to all his holy ones, to the sons of Israel, to a people close to him. Alleluia.\f + \fr 148:14 \ft The word ‘confessio’ can refer to confessing or admitting something (e.g. that God is Lord of heaven and earth). It can also refer to an acknowledgment or understanding about something (e.g. having a belief in God). Such an admission or acknowledgment often has a pervasive element of praise and thanksgiving to God. However, the translation of ‘confessio’ as if it meant merely ‘to give praise’ is not accurate.\f*
\c 149
\cl Psalm 149
\d
\v 1 Alleluia.
\p Sing to the Lord a new song. His praise is in the Church of the saints.
\p
\v 2 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them, and let the sons of Zion exult in their king.
\p
\v 3 Let them praise his name in chorus. Let them sing psalms to him with the timbrel and the psaltery.
\p
\v 4 For the Lord is well pleased with his people, and he will exalt the meek unto salvation.
\p
\v 5 The saints will exult in glory. They will rejoice upon their couches.
\p
\v 6 The exultations of God will be in their throat, and two-edged swords will be in their hands:
\p
\v 7 to obtain vindication among the nations, chastisements among the peoples,
\p
\v 8 to bind their kings with shackles and their nobles with manacles of iron,
\p
\v 9 to obtain judgment over them, as it has been written. This is glory for all his saints. Alleluia.
\c 150
\cl Psalm 150
\d
\v 1 Alleluia.
\p Praise the Lord in his holy places. Praise him in the firmament of his power.
\p
\v 2 Praise him for his virtues. Praise him according to the multitude of his greatness.\f + \fr 150:2 \ft The word ‘virtutibus’ or ‘virtutis’ is often translated as ‘power.’ However, it has a broader meaning in Latin that can mean ‘power,’ or ‘virtue,’ or ‘excellence.’\f*
\p
\v 3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with psaltery and stringed instrument.
\p
\v 4 Praise him with timbrel and choir. Praise him with strings and organ.
\p
\v 5 Praise him with sweet-sounding cymbals. Praise him with cymbals of jubilation.
\p
\v 6 Let every spirit praise the Lord. Alleluia.
